#### Whiteboard/Notepad (Just throw random thoughts here)
- Search and get top N results from Wikipedia instead of just one
- Use the New York, Iowa, and National 8th Grade and High School Science Standards to systematically add to the knowledge base
     - Dig around places like NSTA website
- Try conversion of text to logical standard form
