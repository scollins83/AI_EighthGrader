guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-4 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the gnb4 gene
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (g proteins) which integrate signals between receptors and effector proteins are composed of an alpha a beta and a gamma subunit these subunits are encoded by families of related genes this gene encodes a beta subunit beta subunits are important regulators of alpha subunits as well as of certain signal transduction receptors and effectors
