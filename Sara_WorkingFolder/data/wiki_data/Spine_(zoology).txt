in a zoological context a spine is a hard needle-like anatomical structure spines are found in a wide range of animals both vertebrate and invertebrate
in most spiny mammals the spines are modified hairs with a spongy center covered in a thick hard layer of keratin and a sharp sometimes barbed tip
== occurrence ==
=== mammals ===
spines in mammals include the prickles of hedgehogs and the quills of porcupines as well as the prickly fur of spiny mice and tenrec they are also found on echidna a monotreme
the ancient precursor to mammals dimetrodon had extremely long spines on their backbone that were joined together with a web of skin to form a sail-like structure
many mammalian species also have penile spines
the mesozoic eutriconodont mammal spinolestes already displayed spines similar to those of modern spiny mice
=== fish ===
spines are found in the rays of certain finned bony fishes including scorpion fish the sting that is found in a stingray is a type of barbed spine
=== invertebrates ===
spines are also found in invertebrate animals such as sea urchins they are a feature of the shell of a number of different species of gastropod and bivalve mollusks including the venus clam pitar lupanaria
spines are also found in internal organs in invertebrates such as the copulatory spines in the male or female organs of certain flatworms
== function ==
in many cases spines are a defense mechanism that help protect the animal against potential predators because spines are sharp they can puncture skin and inflict pain and damage which may cause the predator to avoid that species from that point on
the spine of some animals are capable of injecting venom in the case of some large species of stingray a puncture with the barbed spine and the accompanying venom has occasionally been fatal to a human
animals such as porcupines are considered aposematic because their spines warn predators that they are dangerous and potentially toxic porcupines rattle their quills as a warning to predators much like rattlesnakes
== treating injuries caused by spines ==
because many species of fish and invertebrates carry venom within their spines a general rule of thumb is to treat every injury as if it were a snake bite venom can cause intense pain and can sometimes result in death if left untreated
on the other hand being pricked by a porcupine quill is not dangerous and the quills are not poisonous the quill can be removed by gently but firmly pulling it out of the skin the barbed tip sometimes breaks off but it works its way out through the skin over time
== human uses ==
common uses for animal spines include:
jewelry
bracelets earrings and necklaces made from these spines are very common
tribes from around the world use porcupine quills as jewelry for their body modification i.e through the nose
pens
some of the earliest pens were made from quills
sometimes :
brush paintbrush
