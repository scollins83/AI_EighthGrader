the placenta (also known as afterbirth) is an organ that connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake waste elimination and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply fight against internal infection and produce hormones to support pregnancy the placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to growing babies and removes waste products from the baby's blood the placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus and the baby's umbilical cord develops from the placenta the umbilical cord is what connects the mother and the baby placentas are a defining characteristic of placental mammals but are also found in some non-mammals with varying levels of development the homology of such structures in various viviparous organisms is debatable and in invertebrates such as arthropoda is analogous at best
the word placenta comes from the latin word for cake from greek / plakenta/plakonta accusative of / plakeis/plakos "flat slab-like" in reference to its round flat appearance in humans the classical plural is placentae but the form placentas is common in modern english and probably has the wider currency at present
prototherial (egg-laying) and metatherial (marsupial) mammals produce a choriovitelline placenta that while connected to the uterine wall provides nutrients mainly derived from the egg sac
the placenta functions as a fetomaternal organ with two components: the fetal placenta (chorion frondosum) which develops from the same blastocyst that forms the fetus and the maternal placenta (decidua basalis) which develops from the maternal uterine tissue
== structure ==
in humans the placenta averages 22 cm (9 inch) in length and 22.5 cm (0.81 inch) in thickness with the center being the thickest and the edges being the thinnest it typically weighs approximately 500 grams (just over 1 lb) it has a dark reddish-blue or crimson color it connects to the fetus by an umbilical cord of approximately 5560 cm (2224 inch) in length which contains two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein the umbilical cord inserts into the chorionic plate (has an eccentric attachment) vessels branch out over the surface of the placenta and further divide to form a network covered by a thin layer of cells this results in the formation of villous tree structures on the maternal side these villous tree structures are grouped into lobules called cotyledons in humans the placenta usually has a disc shape but size varies vastly between different mammalian species
== physiology ==
=== development ===
the placenta begins to develop upon implantation of the blastocyst into the maternal endometrium the outer layer of the blastocyst becomes the trophoblast which forms the outer layer of the placenta this outer layer is divided into two further layers: the underlying cytotrophoblast layer and the overlying syncytiotrophoblast layer the syncytiotrophoblast is a multinucleated continuous cell layer that covers the surface of the placenta it forms as a result of differentiation and fusion of the underlying cytotrophoblast cells a process that continues throughout placental development the syncytiotrophoblast (otherwise known as syncytium) thereby contributes to the barrier function of the placenta
the placenta grows throughout pregnancy development of the maternal blood supply to the placenta is complete by the end of the first trimester of pregnancy (approximately 1213 weeks)
=== placental circulation ===
==== maternal placental circulation ====
in preparation for implantation of the blastocyst the uterine endometrium undergoes "decidualisation" spiral arteries in decidua are remodeled so that they become less convoluted and their diameter is increased the increased diameter and straighter flow path both act to increase maternal blood flow to the placenta the relatively high pressure as the maternal blood fills intervillous space through these spiral arteries bathes the fetal villi in blood allowing an exchange of gases to take place in humans and other hemochorial placentals the maternal blood comes into direct contact with the fetal chorion though no fluid is exchanged as the pressure decreases between pulses the deoxygenated blood flows back through the endometrial veins
maternal blood flow is approximately 600700 ml/min at term
==== fetoplacental circulation ====
deoxygenated fetal blood passes through umbilical arteries to the placenta at the junction of umbilical cord and placenta the umbilical arteries branch radially to form chorionic arteries chorionic arteries in turn branch into cotyledon arteries in the villi these vessels eventually branch to form an extensive arterio-capillary-venous system bringing the fetal blood extremely close to the maternal blood; but no intermingling of fetal and maternal blood occurs ("placental barrier")
endothelin and prostanoids cause vasoconstriction in placental arteries while nitric oxide causes vasodilation on the other hand there is no neural vascular regulation and catecholamines have only little effect
the fetoplacental circulation is vulnerable to persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation which can lead to generation of excessive free radicals this may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other pregnancy complications it is proposed that melatonin plays a role as an antioxidant in the placenta
=== birth ===
placental expulsion begins as a physiological separation from the wall of the uterus the period from just after the child is born until just after the placenta is expelled is called the "third stage of labor" the placenta is usually expelled within 1530 minutes of birth
placental expulsion can be managed actively for example by giving oxytocin via intramuscular injection followed by cord traction to assist in delivering the placenta alternatively it can be managed expectantly allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance a cochrane database study suggests that blood loss and the risk of postpartum bleeding will be reduced in women offered active management of the third stage of labour (needs updating)
the habit is to cut the cord immediately after birth but allegedly there is no medical reason to do that; on the contrary it is theorized that not cutting the cord helps the baby in its adaptation to extrauterine life especially in preterm infants
== functions ==
=== nutrition ===
the perfusion of the intervillous spaces of the placenta with maternal blood allows the transfer of nutrients and oxygen from the mother to the fetus and the transfer of waste products and carbon dioxide back from the fetus to the maternal blood supply nutrient transfer to the fetus occurs via both active and passive transport active transport systems allow significantly different plasma concentrations of various large molecules to be maintained on the maternal and fetal sides of the placental barrier adverse pregnancy situations such as those involving maternal diabetes or obesity can increase or decrease levels of nutrient transporters in the placenta resulting in overgrowth or restricted growth of the fetus
=== excretion ===
waste products excreted from the fetus such as urea uric acid and creatinine are transferred to the maternal blood by diffusion across the placenta
=== immunity ===
igg antibodies can pass through the human placenta thereby providing protection to the fetus in utero this transfer of antibodies begins as early as the 20th week of gestational age and certainly by the 24th week this passive immunity lingers for several months after birth thus providing the newborn with a carbon copy of the mother's long-term humoral immunity to see the infant through the crucial first months of extrauterine life igm however cannot cross the placenta which is why some infections acquired during pregnancy can be hazardous for the fetus
furthermore the placenta functions as a selective maternal-fetal barrier against transmission of microbes however insufficiency in this function may still cause mother-to-child transmission of infectious diseases
=== endocrine function ===
during pregnancy a womans hormones go through many significant changes hormones have a very important role in the human body especially during pregnancy hormones help the body function and change by causing communication from organs to tissues throughout the body hormones regulate the body physiologically and in other ways including: digestion metabolism respiration tissue function sensory perception sleep excretion lactation stress growth and development movement reproduction and mood the excretion of hormones is effected by other hormones mental activity environmental changes and the concentrations of ions or nutrients throughout the bloodstream hormones aid in metabolism regulation immune system changes cravings reproductive changes etc
the placenta among many of its other functions also secretes hormones that are essential to fetal life
the first hormone released by the placenta is called the human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) hormone this is responsible for stopping the process at the end of menses when the corpus luteum quits working and atrophies if hcg did not interrupt this process it would lead to spontaneous abortion of the fetus the corpus luteum also produces and releases progesterone and estrogen and hcg stimulates it to increase the amount that it releases hcg is also what is the indicator of pregnancy and the hormone that pregnancy tests look for these tests will work when menses has not occurred or after implantation has happened on days seven to ten hcg may also have an anti-antibody effect protecting it from being rejected by the mothers body hcg also assists the male fetus by stimulating the testes to produce testosterone which is the hormone needed to allow the sex organs of the male to grow
progesterone helps the embryo implant by assisting passage through the fallopian tubes it also affects the fallopian tubes and the uterus by stimulating an increase in secretions necessary for fetal nutrition progesterone like hcg is necessary to prevent spontaneous abortion because it prevents contractions of the uterus and is necessary for implantation
estrogen is a crucial hormone in the process of proliferation this involves the enlargement of the breasts and uterus allowing for growth of the fetus and production of milk estrogen is also responsible for increased blood supply towards the end of pregnancy through vasodilation the levels of estrogen during pregnancy can increase so that they are thirty times what a non-pregnant woman mid-cycles estrogen level would be
human placental lactogen (hpl) is a hormone used in pregnancy to develop fetal metabolism and general growth and development human placental lactogen works with human growth hormone (hgh) to stimulate insulin-like growth factor (igf) production and regulating intermediary metabolism in th fetus hpl acts on lactogenic receptors to modulate embryonic development metabolism and stimulate production of igf insulin surfactant and adrenocortical hormones hpl values increase with multiple pregnancies intact molar pregnancy diabetes and rh incompatibilities they are decreased with toxemia choriocarcinoma placental insufficiency and placental insufficiency
=== cloaking from immune system of mother ===
the placenta and fetus may be regarded as a foreign allograft inside the mother and thus must evade from attack by the mother's immune system
for this purpose the placenta uses several mechanisms:
it secretes neurokinin b-containing phosphocholine molecules this is the same mechanism used by parasitic nematodes to avoid detection by the immune system of their host
there is presence of small lymphocytic suppressor cells in the fetus that inhibit maternal cytotoxic t cells by inhibiting the response to interleukin 2
however the placental barrier is not the sole means to evade the immune system as foreign fetal cells also persist in the maternal circulation on the other side of the placental barrier
=== other functions ===
the placenta also provides a reservoir of blood for the fetus delivering blood to it in case of hypotension and vice versa comparable to a capacitor
== clinical significance ==
numerous pathologies can affect the placenta
placenta accreta when the placenta implants too deeply all the way to the actual muscle of uterine wall (without penetrating it)
placenta praevia when the placement of the placenta is too close to or blocks the cervix
placental abruption/abruptio placentae
infections involving the placenta:
placentitis such as the torch infections
chorioamnionitis
== society and culture ==
the placenta often plays an important role in various cultures with many societies conducting rituals regarding its disposal in the western world the placenta is most often incinerated
some cultures bury the placenta for various reasons the mori of new zealand traditionally bury the placenta from a newborn child to emphasize the relationship between humans and the earth likewise the navajo bury the placenta and umbilical cord at a specially chosen site particularly if the baby dies during birth in cambodia and costa rica burial of the placenta is believed to protect and ensure the health of the baby and the mother if a mother dies in childbirth the aymara of bolivia bury the placenta in a secret place so that the mother's spirit will not return to claim her baby's life
the placenta is believed by some communities to have power over the lives of the baby or its parents the kwakiutl of british columbia bury girls' placentas to give the girl skill in digging clams and expose boys' placentas to ravens to encourage future prophetic visions in turkey the proper disposal of the placenta and umbilical cord is believed to promote devoutness in the child later in life in ukraine transylvania and japan interaction with a disposed placenta is thought to influence the parents' future fertility
several cultures believe the placenta to be or have been alive often a relative of the baby nepalese think of the placenta as a friend of the baby; malaysian orang asli regard it as the baby's older sibling the igbo of nigeria consider the placenta the deceased twin of the baby and conduct full funeral rites for it native hawaiians believe that the placenta is a part of the baby and traditionally plant it with a tree that can then grow alongside the child various cultures in indonesia such as javanese believe that the placenta has a spirit and needs to be buried outside the family house
in some cultures the placenta is eaten a practice known as placentophagy in some eastern cultures such as china the dried placenta (ziheche  lit "purple river cart") is thought to be a healthful restorative and is sometimes used in preparations of traditional chinese medicine and various health products the practice of human placentophagy has become a more recent trend in western cultures and is not without controversy; its practice being considered cannibalism is debated
some cultures have alternative uses for placenta that include the manufacturing of cosmetics pharmaceuticals and food
