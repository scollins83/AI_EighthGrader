virus classification is the process of naming viruses and placing them into a taxonomic system similar to the classification systems used for cellular organisms virus classification is the subject of ongoing debate and proposals this is mainly due to the pseudo-living nature of viruses which is to say they are non-living particles with some chemical characteristics similar to those of life as such they do not fit neatly into the established biological classification system in place for cellular organisms
viruses are mainly classified by phenotypic characteristics such as morphology nucleic acid type mode of replication host organisms and the type of disease they cause currently two main schemes are used for the classification of viruses: the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ictv) system and baltimore classification system which places viruses into one of seven groups accompanying this broad method of classification are specific naming conventions and further classification guidelines set out by the ictv
a catalog of all the world's viruses has been proposed; some related preliminary efforts have been accomplished
== virus species definition ==
species form the basis for any biological classification system the ictv had adopted the principle that a virus species is a polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecological niche in july 2013 the ictv definition of species changed to state: "a species is a monophyletic group of viruses whose properties can be distinguished from those of other species by multiple criteria."
== ictv classification ==
the international committee on taxonomy of viruses began to devise and implement rules for the naming and classification of viruses early in the 1970s an effort that continues to the present the ictv is the only body charged by the international union of microbiological societies with the task of developing refining and maintaining a universal virus taxonomy
the system shares many features with the classification system of cellular organisms such as taxon structure however this system of nomenclature differs from other taxonomic codes on several points a minor point is that names of orders and families are italicized unlike in the international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants and international code of zoological nomenclature
viral classification starts at the level of order and continues as follows with the taxon suffixes given in italics:
order (-virales)
family (-viridae)
subfamily (-virinae)
genus (-virus)
species
species names generally take the form of [disease] virus
the establishment of an order is based on the inference that the virus families it contains have most likely evolved from a common ancestor the majority of virus families remain unplaced currently (2012) seven orders 96 families 22 subfamilies 420 genera and 2,618 species of viruses have been defined by the ictv the orders are the caudovirales herpesvirales ligamenvirales mononegavirales nidovirales picornavirales and tymovirales these orders span viruses with varying host ranges the ligamenvirales infecting archaea are the most recent addition to the classification system
caudovirales are tailed dsdna (group i) bacteriophages
herpesvirales contain large eukaryotic dsdna viruses
ligamenvirales contains linear dsdna (group i) archaean viruses
mononegavirales include nonsegmented (-) strand ssrna (group v) plant and animal viruses
nidovirales are composed of (+) strand ssrna (group iv) viruses with vertebrate hosts
picornavirales contains small (+) strand ssrna viruses that infect a variety of plant insect and animal hosts
tymovirales contain monopartite (+) ssrna viruses that infect plants
other variations occur between the orders: nidovirales for example are isolated for their differentiation in expressing structural and nonstructural proteins separately
== structure-based virus classification ==
it has been suggested that similarity in virion assembly and structure observed for certain viral groups infecting hosts from different domains of life (e.g. bacterial tectiviruses and eukaryotic adenoviruses or prokaryotic caudovirales and eukaryotic herpesviruses) reflects an evolutionary relationship between these viruses therefore structural relationship between viruses has been suggested to be used as a basis for defining higher-level taxa - structure-based viral lineages - that could complement the existing ictv classification scheme
== baltimore classification ==
baltimore classification (first defined in 1971) is a classification system that places viruses into one of seven groups depending on a combination of their nucleic acid (dna or rna) strandedness (single-stranded or double-stranded) sense and method of replication named after david baltimore a nobel prize-winning biologist these groups are designated by roman numerals other classifications are determined by the disease caused by the virus or its morphology neither of which are satisfactory due to different viruses either causing the same disease or looking very similar in addition viral structures are often difficult to determine under the microscope classifying viruses according to their genome means that those in a given category will all behave in a similar fashion offering some indication of how to proceed with further research viruses can be placed in one of the seven following groups:
i: dsdna viruses (e.g adenoviruses herpesviruses poxviruses)
ii: ssdna viruses (+ strand or "sense") dna (e.g parvoviruses)
iii: dsrna viruses (e.g reoviruses)
iv: (+)ssrna viruses (+ strand or sense) rna (e.g picornaviruses togaviruses)
v: ()ssrna viruses ( strand or antisense) rna (e.g orthomyxoviruses rhabdoviruses)
vi: ssrna-rt viruses (+ strand or sense) rna with dna intermediate in life-cycle (e.g retroviruses)
vii: dsdna-rt viruses (e.g hepadnaviruses)
=== dna viruses ===
group i: viruses possess double-stranded dna viruses that cause chickenpox and herpes are found here
group ii: viruses possess single-stranded dna
=== rna viruses ===
group iii: viruses possess double-stranded rna genomes e.g rotavirus
group iv: viruses possess positive-sense single-stranded rna genomes many well known viruses are found in this group including the picornaviruses (which is a family of viruses that includes well-known viruses like hepatitis a virus enteroviruses rhinoviruses poliovirus and foot-and-mouth virus) sars virus hepatitis c virus yellow fever virus and rubella virus
group v: viruses possess negative-sense single-stranded rna genomes the deadly ebola and marburg viruses are well known members of this group along with influenza virus measles mumps and rabies
=== reverse transcribing viruses ===
group vi: viruses possess single-stranded rna viruses that replicate through a dna intermediate the retroviruses are included in this group of which hiv is a member
group vii: viruses possess double-stranded dna genomes and replicate using reverse transcriptase the hepatitis b virus can be found in this group
== holmes classification ==
holmes (1948) used carl linnaeus's system of binomial nomenclature to classify viruses into 3 groups under one order virales they are placed as follows:
group i: phaginae (attacks bacteria)
group ii: phytophaginae (attacks plants)
group iii: zoophaginae (attacks animals)
== lht system of virus classification ==
the lht system of virus classification is based on chemical and physical characters like nucleic acid (dna or rna) symmetry (helical or icosahedral or complex) presence of envelope diameter of capsid number of capsomers this classification was approved by the provisional committee on nomenclature of virus (pnvc) of the international association of microbiological societies (1962) it is as follows:
phylum vira (divided into 2 subphyla)
subphylum deoxyvira (dna viruses)
class deoxybinala (dual symmetry)
order urovirales
family phagoviridae
class deoxyhelica (helical symmetry)
order chitovirales
family poxviridae
class deoxycubica (cubical symmetry)
order peplovirales
family herpesviridae (162 capsomeres)
order haplovirales (no envelope)
family iridoviridae (812 capsomeres)
family adenoviridae (252 capsomeres)
family papiloviridae (72 capsomeres)
family paroviridae (32 capsomeres)
family microviridae (12 capsomeres)
subphylum ribovira (rna viruses)
class ribocubica
order togovirales
family arboviridae
order lymovirales
family napoviridae
family reoviridae
class ribohelica
order sagovirales

genus cocadviroid; type species: coconut cadang-cadang viroid
genus apscaviroid; type species: apple scar skin viroid
genus coleviroid; type species: coleus blumei viroid 1
=== satellites ===
satellites depend on co-infection of a host cell with a helper virus for productive multiplication their nucleic acids have substantially distinct nucleotide sequences from either their helper virus or host when a satellite subviral agent encodes the coat protein in which it is encapsulated it is then called a satellite virus
satellite virusessingle-stranded rna satellite viruses

single-stranded satellite rnas
subgroup 1: large satellite rnas
subgroup 2: small linear satellite rnas
subgroup 3: circular satellite rnas (virusoids)
=== prions ===
prions named for their description as "proteinaceous and infectious particles" lack any detectable (as of 2002) nucleic acids or virus-like particles they resist inactivation procedures that normally affect nucleic acids
mammalian prions:
agents of spongiform encephalopathies
fungal prions:
psi+ prion of saccharomyces cerevisiae
