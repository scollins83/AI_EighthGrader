the spermatophytes (from the greek word "") also known as phanerogams or phenogamae comprise those plants that produce seeds hence the alternative name seed plants they are a subset of the embryophytes or land plants the term phanerogams or phanerogamae is derived from the greek  phaneros = "visible" in contrast to the cryptogamae from greek kryptos = "hidden" together with the suffix  gameein "to marry" these terms distinguished those plants with hidden sexual organs (cryptogamae) from those with visible sexual organs (phanerogamae)
== description ==
the living spermatophytes form five groups:
cycads a subtropical and tropical group of plants with a large crown of compound leaves and a stout trunk
ginkgo a single living species of tree
conifers cone-bearing trees and shrubs
gnetophytes woody plants in the genera ephedra gnetum and welwitschia
angiosperms (or magnoliophyta) the flowering plants a large group including many familiar plants in a wide variety of habitats
in addition to the taxa listed above the fossil record contains evidence of many extinct taxa of seed plants the so-called "seed ferns" (pteridospermae) were one of the earliest successful groups of land plants and forests dominated by seed ferns were prevalent in the late paleozoic glossopteris was the most prominent tree genus in the ancient southern supercontinent of gondwana during the permian period by the triassic period seed ferns had declined in ecological importance and representatives of modern gymnosperm groups were abundant and dominant through the end of the cretaceous when angiosperms radiated another late paleozoic group of probable spermatophytes were the gigantopterids
== evolution ==
a whole genome duplication event in the ancestor of seed plants occurred about 319 million years ago this gave rise to a series of evolutionary changes that resulted in the origin of seed plants
a middle devonian precursor to seed plants from belgium has been identified predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years runcaria small and radially symmetrical is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule the megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the mutlilobed integument it is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination runcaria sheds new light on the sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed runcaria has all of the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed
== relationships and nomenclature ==
seed-bearing plants were traditionally divided into angiosperms or flowering plants and gymnosperms which includes the gnetophytes cycads ginkgo and conifers older morphological studies believed in a close relationship between the gnetophytes and the angiosperms in particular based on vessel elements however molecular studies (and some more recent morphological and fossil papers) have generally shown a clade of gymnosperms with the gnetophytes in or near the conifers for example one common proposed set of relationships is known as the gne-pine hypothesis and looks like:
however the relationships between these groups should not be considered settled
other classifications group all the seed plants in a single division with classes for our five groups:
division spermatophyta
cycadopsida the cycads
ginkgoopsida the ginkgo
pinopsida the conifers ("coniferopsida")
gnetopsida the gnetophytes
magnoliopsida the flowering plants or angiospermopsida
a more modern classification ranks these groups as separate divisions (sometimes under the superdivision spermatophyta):
cycadophyta the cycads
ginkgophyta the ginkgo
pinophyta the conifers
gnetophyta the gnetophytes
magnoliophyta the flowering plants
