morality (from the latin moralitas "manner character proper behavior") is the differentiation of intentions decisions and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper: in other words it is the disjunction between right and wrong morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy religion or culture or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal morality may also be specifically synonymous with "goodness" or "rightness."
moral philosophy includes moral ontology or the origin of morals as well as moral epistemology or what is known about morals different systems of expressing morality have been proposed including deontological ethical systems which adhere to a set of established rules and normative ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves an example of normative ethical philosophy is the golden rule which states that "one should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself."
immorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e opposition to that which is good or right) while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of indifference toward or disbelief in any set of moral standards or principles

=== ethicsedit ===
ethics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of philosophy which addresses questions of morality the word "ethics" is "commonly used interchangeably with 'morality,' and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition group or individual." likewise certain types of ethical theories especially deontological ethics sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals: "although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of immanuel kant based on notions such as duty obligation and principles of conduct reserving ethics for the more aristotelian approach to practical reasoning based on the notion of a virtue and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations."
=== descriptive and normativeedit ===
in its descriptive sense "morality" refers to personal or cultural values codes of conduct or social mores it does not connote objective claims of right or wrong but only refers to that which is considered right or wrong descriptive ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense
in its normative sense "morality" refers to whatever (if anything) is actually right or wrong which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures normative ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense
=== realism and anti-realismedit ===
philosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is theories of meta-ethics) are broadly divided into two classes:
moral realism is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts for example while they might concede that forces of social conformity significantly shape individuals' "moral" decisions they deny that those cultural norms and customs define morally right behavior this may be the philosophical view propounded by ethical naturalists however not all moral realists accept that position (e.g ethical non-naturalists)
moral anti-realism on the other hand holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts instead they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts (error theory); claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts (ethical subjectivism); or else not attempts to describe the world at all but rather something else like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command (non-cognitivism)
some forms of non-cognitivism and ethical subjectivism while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here are considered realist in the sense synonymous with moral universalism for example universal prescriptivism is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives and divine command theory and ideal observer theory are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being respectively
== anthropologyedit ==
=== tribal and territorialedit ===
celia green made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality she characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a persons territory including his or her property and dependents which is not to be damaged or interfered with apart from these proscriptions territorial morality is permissive allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another by contrast tribal morality is prescriptive imposing the norms of the collective on the individual these norms will be arbitrary culturally dependent and flexible whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute such as kants categorical imperative and geisler's graded absolutism green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property and the ascendancy of contract over status
=== in-group and out-groupedit ===
some observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an "in-group" (the individual and those they believe to be of the same culture or race) or an "out-group" (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules) some biologists anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival this belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution in simulations this discrimination can result in both unexpected cooperation towards the in-group and irrational hostility towards the out-group gary r johnson and v.s falger have argued that nationalism and patriotism are forms of this in-group/out-group boundary jonathan haidt has noted that experimental observation indicating an in-group criterion provides one moral foundation substantially used by conservatives but far less so by liberals
=== comparing culturesedit ===
peterson and seligman approach the anthropological view looking across cultures geo-cultural areas and across millennia they conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined the major virtues they identified include wisdom / knowledge; courage; humanity; justice; temperance; and transcendence each of these includes several divisions for instance humanity includes love kindness and social intelligence
fons trompenaars author of did the pedestrian die? tested members of different cultures with various moral dilemmas one of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend a passenger riding in the car lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations (from none to almost certain)
john newton author of complete conduct principles for the 21st century compared the eastern and the western cultures about morality as stated in complete conduct principles for the 21st century one of the important objectives of this book is to blend harmoniously the fine souls regarding conduct in the eastern and the western cultures to take the result as the source and then to create newer and better conduct principles to suit the human society of the new century and to introduce a lot of chinese fine conduct spirits to the western world it is hoped that this helps solve lots of problems the human society of the 21st century faces including (but not limited to the eastern and the western cultures) what a single culture cannot
== evolutionedit ==
the development of modern morality is a process closely tied to sociocultural evolution some evolutionary biologists particularly sociobiologists believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through group selection (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory) some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival and/or reproductive benefits (i.e increased evolutionary success) humans consequently evolved "pro-social" emotions such as feelings of empathy or guilt in response to these moral behaviors
on this understanding moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically-driven behaviors which encourage human cooperation biologists contend that all social animals from ants to elephants have modified their behaviors by restraining immediate selfishness in order to improve their evolutionary fitness human morality although sophisticated and complex relative to other animals is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness
on this view moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction (inclusive fitness) examples: the maternal bond is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the westermarck effect where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction underpins taboos against incest because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as inbreeding
the phenomenon of reciprocity in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably for example some vampire bats fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (wilkinson 1984)
marc bekoff and jessica pierce (2009) have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups (e.g. wolves coyotes elephants dolphins rats chimpanzees) they define morality as "a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups." this suite of behaviors includes empathy reciprocity altruism cooperation and a sense of fairness in related work it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show empathy for each other in a wide variety of contexts they also possess the ability to engage in deception and a level of social politics prototypical of our own tendencies for gossip and reputation management
christopher boehm (1982) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout hominid evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size and in particular the development of theory of mind abilities
a british poll found that the most important moral points among young people were looking after ones family and putting others before yourself
== neuroscienceedit ==
the brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated by a quantitative large-scale meta-analysis of the brain activity changes reported in the moral neuroscience literature in fact the neural network underlying moral decisions overlapped with the network pertaining to representing others' intentions (i.e. theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others' (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e. empathy) this supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons points of view and to grasping others feelings these results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e. there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems
=== brain areasedit ===
the explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmpc) while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the temporoparietal junction area
stimulation of the vmpc by transcranial magnetic stimulation has been shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment according to this investigation tms did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moral judgment on the contrary moral judgments of intentional harms and nonharms were unaffected by tms to either the rtpj or the control site; presumably however people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs so why were moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by tms to the rtpj one possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time on the basis of this view when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other morally relevant factors (e.g. outcome) alternatively following tms to the rtpj moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account on either account when belief information is degraded or unavailable moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g. outcome) for intentional harms and nonharms however the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as the intention thus the researchers suggest that tms to the rtpj disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own
similarly vmpc-impaired persons will judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action
=== mirror neuronsedit ===
mirror neurons are neurons in the brain that fire when another person is observed doing a certain action the neurons fire in imitation of the action being observed causing the same muscles to act minutely in the observer as are acting grossly in the person actually performing the action research on mirror neurons since their discovery in 1996 suggests that they may have a role to play not only in action understanding but also in emotion sharing empathy cognitive neuro-scientist jean decety thinks that the ability to recognize and vicariously experience what another individual is undergoing was a key step forward in the evolution of social behavior and ultimately morality the inability to feel empathy is one of the defining characteristics of psychopathy and this would appear to lend support to decety's view
== psychologyedit ==
in modern moral psychology morality is considered to change through personal development a number of psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals usually going through stages of different morals lawrence kohlberg jean piaget and elliot turiel have cognitive-developmental approaches to moral development; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains social psychologists such as martin hoffman and jonathan haidt emphasize social and emotional development based on biology such as empathy moral identity theorists such as william damon and mordechai nisan see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes of historical interest in psychology are the theories of psychoanalysts such as sigmund freud who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the super-ego as guilt-shame avoidance
even though we have a sense of responsibility to pursue moral purposes we still at least occasionally engage in immoral behaviour such behaviours jeopardize our moral self-image; however when we engage in immoral behaviours we still feel as though we are moral individuals moral self-licensing attempts to explain this phenomenon and proposes that self-image security increases our likelihood to engage in immoral behaviour when our moral self-image is threatened we can gain confidence from our past moral behaviour the more confident we are the less we will worry about our future behaviour which actually increases the likelihood that we will engage in immoral behaviours
monin and miller (2001) examined the moral self-licensing effect and found that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons they were more willing to express politically incorrect opinions despite the fact that the audience was unaware of their credentials
== morality and politicsedit ==
if morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live' at the individual level politics can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level though the political sphere raises additional problems and challenges it is therefore unsurprising that evidence has been found of a relationship between attitudes in morality and politics jonathan haidt and jesse graham have studied the differences between liberals and conservatives in this regard haidt found that americans who identified as liberals tended to value care and fairness higher than loyalty respect and purity self-identified conservative americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting but conservatives valued fairness the lowest whereas liberals valued purity the lowest haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the united states can be traced to geohistorical factors with conservatism strongest in closely knit ethnically homogenous communities in contrast to port-cities where the cultural mix is greater thus requiring more liberalism
group morality develops from shared concepts and beliefs and is often codified to regulate behavior within a culture or community various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess "moral fiber" whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate the continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of cistercian reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the dowager empress in the subjugation of china to european interests) within nationalist movements there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality regardless of its content political morality is also relevant to the behaviour internationally of national governments and to the support they receive from their host population noam chomsky states that
 if we adopt the principle of universality : if an action is right (or wrong) for others it is right (or wrong) for us those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to othersmore stringent ones in factplainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong good and evil in fact one of the maybe the most elementary of moral principles is that of universality that is if something's right for me it's right for you; if it's wrong for you it's wrong for me any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow
== morality and religionedit ==
religion and morality are not synonymous morality does not depend upon religion although for some this is "an almost automatic assumption" according to the westminster dictionary of christian ethics religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other conceptually and in principle morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."
=== positionsedit ===
within the wide range of moral traditions religious value systems co-exist with contemporary secular frameworks such as consequentialism freethought humanism utilitarianism and others there are many types of religious value systems modern monotheistic religions such as islam judaism christianity and to a certain degree others such as sikhism and zoroastrianism define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith other religions spanning pantheistic to nontheistic tend to be less absolute for example within buddhism the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for to determine if an action is right or wrong a further disparity between the values of religious traditions is pointed out by barbara stoler miller who states that in hinduism "practically right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank kinship and stages of life for modern westerners who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of hinduism most difficult to understand"
religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas for example there is no absolute prohibition on killing in hinduism which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances in monotheistic traditions certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms such as abortion or divorce religion is not always positively associated with morality philosopher david hume stated that "the greatest crimes have been found in many instances to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises even though he himself believe them sincere."
religious value systems can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions such as those on murder mass atrocities and slavery for example simon blackburn states that "apologists for hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system and apologists for islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels" in regard to christianity he states that the "bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children the mentally handicapped animals the environment the divorced unbelievers people with various sexual habits and elderly women" and notes morally suspect themes in the bible's new testament as well christian apologists address blackburn's viewpoints and construe that jewish laws in the jewish bible showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not property elizabeth anderson holds that "the bible contains both good and evil teachings" and it is "morally inconsistent" humanists like paul kurtz believe that we can identify moral values across cultures even if we do not appeal to a supernatural or universalist understanding of principles - values including integrity trustworthiness benevolence and fairness these values can be resources for finding common ground between believers and nonbelievers
=== empirical analysesedit ===
a number of studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries and the overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear a 2001 review of studies on this topic found "the existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied contested and inconclusive and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime." phil zuckerman's 2008 book society without god notes that denmark and sweden "which are probably the least religious countries in the world and possibly in the history of the world" enjoy "among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world"
dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century a 2005 study by gregory s paul published in the journal of religion and society stated that "in general higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide juvenile and early adult mortality std infection rates teen pregnancy and abortion in the prosperous democracies," and "in all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows" with the exceptions being the united states (with a high religiosity level) and "theistic" portugal in a response gary jensen builds on and refines paul's study his conclusion is that a "complex relationship" exists between religiosity and homicide "with some dimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it" on april 26 2012 the results of a study which tested their subjects' pro-social sentiments were published in the social psychological and personality science journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers
