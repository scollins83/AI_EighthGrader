river channel migration is the lateral motion of an alluvial river channel across its floodplain due to processes of erosion of and deposition on its banks and bars in meandering streams channel migration typically takes place by erosion of the cut bank and deposition on the point bar in braided streams channel change occurs due to sediment transport and the motion of barforms through the channel
channel migration is an important engineering problem as it can undercut and damage transportation infrastructure
