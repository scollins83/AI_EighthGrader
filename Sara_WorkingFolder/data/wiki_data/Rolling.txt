rolling is a type of motion that combines rotation (commonly of an axially symmetric object) and translation of that object with respect to a surface (either one or the other moves) such that if ideal conditions exist the two are in contact with each other without sliding
rolling where there is no sliding is referred to as pure rolling by definition there is no sliding when the instantaneous velocity of the rolling object in all the points in which it contacts the surface is the same as that of the surface; in particular for a reference plane in which the rolling surface is at rest the instantaneous velocity of the point of contact of the rolling object is zero
in practice due to small deformations near the contact area some sliding and energy dissipation occurs nevertheless the resulting rolling resistance is much lower than sliding friction and thus rolling objects typically require much less energy to be moved than sliding ones as a result such objects will more easily move if they experience a force with a component along the surface for instance gravity on a tilted surface wind pushing pulling or torque from an engine unlike most axially symmetrical objects the rolling motion of a cone is such that while rolling on a flat surface its center of gravity performs a circular motion rather than linear motion rolling objects are not necessarily axially-symmetrical two well known non-axially-symmetrical rollers are the reuleaux triangle and the meissner bodies the oloid and the sphericon are members of a special family of developable rollers that develop their entire surface when rolling down a flat plane objects with corners such as dice roll by successive rotations about the edge or corner which is in contact with the surface
== applications ==
most land vehicles use wheels and therefore rolling for displacement slip should be kept to a minimum (approximating pure rolling) otherwise loss of control and an accident may result this may happen when the road is covered in snow sand or oil when taking a turn at high speed or attempting to brake or accelerate suddenly
one of the most practical applications of rolling objects is the use of rolling-element bearings such as ball bearings in rotating devices made of metal the rolling elements are usually encased between two rings that can rotate independently of each other in most mechanisms the inner ring is attached to a stationary shaft (or axle) thus while the inner ring is stationary the outer ring is free to move with very little friction this is the basis for which almost all motors (such as those found in ceiling fans cars drills etc.) rely on to operate the amount of friction on the mechanism's parts depends on the quality of the ball bearings and how much lubrication is in the mechanism
rolling objects are also frequently used as tools for transportation one of the most basic ways is by placing a (usually flat) object on a series of lined-up rollers or wheels the object on the wheels can be moved along them in a straight line as long as the wheels are continuously replaced in the front (see history of bearings) this method of primitive transportation is efficient when no other machinery is available today the most practical application of objects on wheels are cars trains and other human transportation vehicles
== physics of simple rolling ==
the simplest case of rolling is that of an axially symmetrical object rolling without slip along a flat surface with its axis parallel to the surface (or equivalently: perpendicular to the surface normal)
the trajectory of any point is a trochoid; in particular the trajectory of any point in the object axis is a line while the trajectory of any point in the object rim is a cycloid
the velocity of any point in the rolling object is given by  where is the displacement between the particle and the rolling object's contact point (or line) with the surface and is the angular velocity vector thus despite that rolling is different from rotation around a fixed axis the instantaneous velocity of all particles of the rolling object is the same as if it was rotating around an axis that passes through the point of contact with the same angular velocity
any point in the rolling object farther from the axis than the point of contact will temporarily move opposite to the direction of the overall motion when it is below the level of the rolling surface (for example any point in the part of the flange of a train wheel that is below the rail)
=== energy ===
since kinetic energy is entirely a function of an object mass and velocity the above result may be used with the parallel axis theorem to obtain the kinetic energy associated with simple rolling:
=== forces and acceleration ===
differentiating the relation between linear and angular velocity  with respect to time gives a formula relating linear and angular acceleration  applying newton's second law:
it follows that to accelerate the object both a net force and a torque are required when external force with no torque acts on the rolling objectsurface system there will be a tangential force at the point of contact between the surface and rolling object that provides the required torque as long as the motion is pure rolling; this force is usually static friction for example between the road and a wheel or between a bowling lane and a bowling ball when static friction isn't enough the friction becomes dynamic friction and slipping happens the tangential force is opposite in direction to the external force and therefore partially cancels it the resulting net force and acceleration are:
has dimension of mass and it is the mass that would have a rotational inertia at distance from an axis of rotation therefore the term may be thought of as the mass with linear inertia equivalent to the rolling object rotational inertia (around its center of mass) the action of the external force upon an object in simple rotation may be conceptualized as accelerating the sum of the real mass and the virtual mass that represents the rotational inertia which is  since the work done by the external force is split between overcoming the translational and rotational inertia the external force results in a smaller net force by the dimensionless multiplicative factor where represents the ratio of the aforesaid virtual mass to the object actual mass and it is equal to where is the radius of gyration corresponding to the object rotational inertia in pure rotation (not the rotational inertia in pure rolling) the square power is due to the fact that the rotational inertia of a point mass varies proportionally to the square of its distance to the axis
in the specific case of an object rolling in an inclined plane which experiences only static friction normal force and its own weight (air drag is absent) the acceleration in the direction of rolling down the slope is:
is specific to the object shape and mass distribution it does not depends on scale or density however it will vary if the object is made to roll with different radiuses; for instance it varies between a train wheel set rolling normally (by its tire) and by its axle it follows that given a reference rolling object another object bigger or with different density will roll with the same acceleration this behavior is the same as that of an object in free fall or an object sliding without friction (instead of rolling) down an incline plane
