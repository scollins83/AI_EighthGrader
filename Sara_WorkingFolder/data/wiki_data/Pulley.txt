a pulley is a wheel on an axle or shaft that is designed to support movement and change of direction of a taut cable or belt along its circumference pulleys are used in a variety of ways to lift loads apply forces and to transmit power in nautical contexts the assembly of wheel axle and supporting shell is referred to as a "block."
a pulley may also be called a sheave or drum and may have a groove between two flanges around its circumference the drive element of a pulley system can be a rope cable belt or chain that runs over the pulley inside the groove
hero of alexandria identified the pulley as one of six simple machines used to lift weights pulleys are assembled to form a block and tackle in order to provide mechanical advantage to apply large forces pulleys are also assembled as part of belt and chain drives in order to transmit power from one rotating shaft to another
== block and tackle ==
a set of pulleys assembled so that they rotate independently on the same axle form a block two blocks with a rope attached to one of the blocks and threaded through the two sets of pulleys form a block and tackle
a block and tackle is assembled so one block is attached to fixed mounting point and the other is attached to the moving load the ideal mechanical advantage of the block and tackle is equal to the number of parts of the rope that support the moving block
in the diagram on the right the ideal mechanical advantage of each of the block and tackle assemblies shown is as follows:
gun tackle: 2
luff tackle: 3
double tackle: 4
gyn tackle: 5
threefold purchase: 6
== rope and pulley systems ==
a rope and pulley system -- that is a block and tackle -- is characterised by the use of a single continuous rope to transmit a tension force around one or more pulleys to lift or move a loadthe rope may be a light line or a strong cable this system is included in the list of simple machines identified by renaissance scientists
if the rope and pulley system does not dissipate or store energy then its mechanical advantage is the number of parts of the rope that act on the load this can be shown as follows
consider the set of pulleys that form the moving block and the parts of the rope that support this block if there are p of these parts of the rope supporting the load w then a force balance on the moving block shows that the tension in each of the parts of the rope must be w/p this means the input force on the rope is t=w/p thus the block and tackle reduces the input force by the factor p
=== how it works ===
the simplest theory of operation for a pulley system assumes that the pulleys and lines are weightless and that there is no energy loss due to friction it is also assumed that the lines do not stretch
in equilibrium the forces on the moving block must sum to zero in addition the tension in the rope must be the same for each of its parts this means that the two parts of the rope supporting the moving block must each support half the load
these are different types of pulley systems:
fixed: a fixed pulley has an axle mounted in bearings attached to a supporting structure a fixed pulley changes the direction of the force on a rope or belt that moves along its circumference mechanical advantage is gained by combining a fixed pulley with a movable pulley or another fixed pulley of a different diameter
movable: a movable pulley has an axle in a movable block a single movable pulley is supported by two parts of the same rope and has a mechanical advantage of two
compound: a combination of fixed and a movable pulleys forms a block and tackle a block and tackle can have several pulleys mounted on the fixed and moving axles further increasing the mechanical advantage
the mechanical advantage of the gun tackle can be increased by interchanging the fixed and moving blocks so the rope is attached to the moving block and the rope is pulled in the direction of the lifted load in this case the block and tackle is said to be "rove to advantage." diagram 3 shows that now three rope parts support the load w which means the tension in the rope is w/3 thus the mechanical advantage is three
by adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same diagram 3a this is an example of the luff tackle
=== free body diagrams ===
the mechanical advantage of a pulley system can be analyzed using free body diagrams which balance the tension force in the rope with the force of gravity on the load in an ideal system the massless and frictionless pulleys do not dissipate energy and allow for a change of direction of a rope that does not stretch or wear in this case a force balance on a free body that includes the load w and n supporting sections of a rope with tension t yields:
the ratio of the load to the input tension force is the mechanical advantage ma of the pulley system
thus the mechanical advantage of the system is equal to the number of sections of rope supporting the load
== belt and pulley systems ==
a belt and pulley system is characterised by two or more pulleys in common to a belt this allows for mechanical power torque and speed to be transmitted across axles if the pulleys are of differing diameters a mechanical advantage is realised
a belt drive is analogous to that of a chain drive however a belt sheave may be smooth (devoid of discrete interlocking members as would be found on a chain sprocket spur gear or timing belt) so that the mechanical advantage is approximately given by the ratio of the pitch diameter of the sheaves only not fixed exactly by the ratio of teeth as with gears and sprockets
in the case of a drum-style pulley without a groove or flanges the pulley often is slightly convex to keep the flat belt centred it is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley though once widely used on factory line shafts this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners in belt sanders and bandsaws agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what belt pulley magazine was named after) it has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use such as power take-off and hydraulics
just as the diameters of gears (and correspondingly their number of teeth) determine a gear ratio and thus the speed increases or reductions and the mechanical advantage that they can deliver the diameters of pulleys determine those same factors cone pulleys and step pulleys (which operate on the same principle although the names tend to be applied to flat belt versions and v belt versions respectively) are a way to provide multiple drive ratios in a belt-and-pulley system that can be shifted as needed just as a transmission provides this function with a gear train that can be shifted v belt step pulleys are the most common way that drill presses deliver a range of spindle speeds
