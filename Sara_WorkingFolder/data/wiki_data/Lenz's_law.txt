lenz's law /lnts/ is a common way of understanding how electromagnetic circuits obey newton's third law and the conservation of energy lenz's law is named after heinrich lenz and it says:
if an induced current flows its direction is always such that it will oppose the change which produced it
lenz's law is shown with the negative sign in faraday's law of induction:
which indicates that the induced voltage () and the change in magnetic flux () have opposite signs lenz's law is a qualitative law that refers to the direction of induced current in relation to the effect which produces it without quantitatively relating their magnitudes
for a rigorous mathematical treatment see electromagnetic induction and maxwell's equations
== opposing currents ==
if a change in the magnetic field of current i1 induces another electric current i2 the direction of i2 is opposite that of the change in i1 if these currents are in two coaxial circular conductors 1 and 2 respectively and both are initially 0 then the currents i1 and i2 must counter-rotate the opposing currents will repel each other as a result
lenz's law states that the current induced in a circuit due to a change or a motion in a magnetic field is so directed as to oppose the change in flux and to exert a mechanical force opposing the motion
=== example ===
currents bound inside the atoms of strong magnets can create counter-rotating currents in a copper or aluminum pipe this is shown by dropping the magnet through the pipe the descent of the magnet inside the pipe is observably slower than when dropped outside the pipe
when a voltage is generated by a change in magnetic flux according to faraday's law the polarity of the induced voltage is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the change which produces it the induced magnetic field inside any loop of wire always acts to keep the magnetic flux in the loop constant in the examples below if the flux is increasing the induced field acts in opposition to it if it is decreasing the induced field acts in the direction of the applied field to oppose the change
== detailed interaction of charges in these currents ==
in electromagnetism when charges move along electric field lines work is done on them whether it involves storing potential energy (negative work) or increasing kinetic energy (positive work)
when net positive work is applied to a charge q1 it gains speed and momentum the net work on q1 thereby generates a magnetic field whose strength (in units of magnetic flux density (1 tesla = 1 volt-second per square meter)) is proportional to the speed increase of q1 this magnetic field can interact with a neighboring charge q2 passing on this momentum to it and in return q1 loses momentum
the charge q2 can also act on q1 in a similar manner by which it returns some of the momentum that it received from q1 this back-and-forth component of momentum contributes to magnetic inductance the closer that q1 and q2 are the greater the effect when q2 is inside a conductive medium such as a thick slab made of copper or aluminum it more readily responds to the force applied to it by q1 the energy of q1 is not instantly consumed as heat generated by the current of q2 but is also stored in two opposing magnetic fields the energy density of magnetic fields tends to vary with the square of the magnetic field's intensity; however in the case of magnetically non-linear materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors this relationship breaks down
== field energy ==
the electric field stores energy the energy density of the electric field is given by:
in general the incremental amount of work per unit volume w needed to cause a small change of magnetic flux density b is:
== conservation of momentum ==
momentum must be conserved in the process so if q1 is pushed in one direction then q2 ought to be pushed in the other direction by the same force at the same time however the situation becomes more complicated when the finite speed of electromagnetic wave propagation is introduced (see retarded potential) this means that for a brief period the total momentum of the two charges is not conserved implying that the difference should be accounted for by momentum in the fields as asserted by richard p feynman famous 19th century electrodynamicist james clerk maxwell called this the "electromagnetic momentum" yet such a treatment of fields may be necessary when lenz's law is applied to opposite charges it is normally assumed that the charges in question have the same sign if they do not such as a proton and an electron the interaction is different an electron generating a magnetic field would generate an emf that causes a proton to accelerate in the same direction as the electron at first this might seem to violate the law of conservation of momentum but such an interaction is seen to conserve momentum if the momentum of electromagnetic fields is taken into account
