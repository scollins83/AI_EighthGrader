an oligotroph is an organism that can live in an environment that offers very low levels of nutrients they may be contrasted with copiotrophs which prefer nutritionally rich environments oligotrophs are characterized by slow growth low rates of metabolism and generally low population density
the adjective oligotrophic may be used to refer to environments that offer little to sustain life organisms that survive in such environments or the adaptations that support survival etymologically the word "oligotroph" is a combination of the greek adjective oligos () meaning "few" and the adjective trophikos ()) meaning "feeding"
oligotrophic environments include deep oceanic sediments caves glacial and polar ice deep subsurface soil aquifers ocean waters and leached soils
examples of oligotrophic organisms are the cave-dwelling olm the bacterium pelagibacter ubique which is the most abundant organism in the oceans with an estimated 2 1028 individuals in total and the lichens with their extremely low metabolic rate
== plant adaptations ==
plant adaptations to oligotrophic soils provide for greater and more efficient nutrient uptake reduced nutrient consumption and efficient nutrient storage improvements in nutrient uptake are facilitated by root adaptations such as nitrogen-fixing root nodules mycorrhizae and cluster roots consumption is reduced by very slow growth rates and by efficient use of low-availability nutrients; for example the use of highly available ions to maintain turgor pressure with low-availability nutrients reserved for the building of tissues despite these adaptations nutrient requirement typically exceed uptake during the growing season so many oligotrophic plants have the ability to store nutrients for example in trunk tissues when demand is low and remobilise them when demand increases
== oligotrophic environments ==
an ecosystem or environment is said to be oligotrophic if it offers little to sustain life the term is commonly utilised to describe environments of water ice air rock or soil with very low nutrient levels
oligotrophic environments are of special interest for the alternative energy sources and survival strategies upon which life could rely
=== antarctic ===
lake vostok a freshwater lake which has been isolated from the world beneath 4 km (2.5 mi) of antarctic ice for approximately 15 million years is frequently held to be a primary example of an oligotrophic environment
=== australia ===
the sandplains and lateritic soils of southern western australia where an extremely thick craton has precluded any geological activity since the cambrian and there has been no glaciation to renew soils since the carboniferous thus soils are extremely nutrient-poor and most vegetation must use strategies such as cluster roots to gain even the smallest quantities of such nutrients as phosphorus and sulfur
the vegetation in these regions however is remarkable for its biodiversity which in places is as great as that of a tropical rainforest and produces some of the most spectacular wildflowers in the world it is however severely threatened by climate change which has moved the winter rain belt south and also by clearing for agriculture and through use of fertilizers which is primarily driven by low land costs which make farming economic even with yields a fraction of those in europe or north america
=== south america ===
an example of oligotrophic soils are those on white-sands with soil ph lower than 5.0 on the rio negro basin on northern amazonia that house very low-diversity extremely fragile forests and savannahs drained by blackwater rivers; dark water colour due to high concentration of tannins humic acids and other organic compounds derived from the very slow decomposition of plant matter similar forests are found in the oligotrophic waters of the pata river delta on the pacific side of the andes
=== ocean ===
in the ocean the subtropical gyres north and south of the equator are regions in which the nutrients required for phytoplankton growth (for instance nitrate phosphate and silicic acid) are strongly depleted all year round these areas are described as oligotrophic and exhibit low surface chlorophyll they are occasionally described as "ocean deserts"
