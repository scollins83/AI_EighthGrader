continental drift is the movement of the earth's continents relative to each other thus appearing to "drift" across the ocean bed the speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by abraham ortelius in 1596 the concept was independently and more fully developed by alfred wegener in 1912 but his theory was rejected by some for lack of a mechanism (though this was supplied later by arthur holmes) and others because of prior theoretical commitments the idea of continental drift has been subsumed by the theory of plate tectonics which explains how the continents move
in 1858 antonio snider-pellegrini created two maps demonstrating how america and africa continents might have once fit together

=== early history ===
abraham ortelius (ortelius 1596) theodor christoph lilienthal (1756) alexander von humboldt (1801 and 1845) antonio snider-pellegrini (snider-pellegrini 1858) and others had noted earlier that the shapes of continents on opposite sides of the atlantic ocean (most notably africa and south america) seem to fit together w j kious described ortelius' thoughts in this way:
abraham ortelius in his work thesaurus geographicus  suggested that the americas were "torn away from europe and africa  by earthquakes and floods" and went on to say: "the vestiges of the rupture reveal themselves if someone brings forward a map of the world and considers carefully the coasts of the three [continents]."
writing in 1889 alfred russel wallace remarks "it was formerly a very general belief even amongst geologists that the great features of the earth's surface no less than the smaller ones were subject to continual mutations and that during the course of known geological time the continents and great oceans had again and again changed places with each other." he quotes charles lyell as saying "continents therefore although permanent for whole geological epochs shift their positions entirely in the course of ages" and claims that the first to throw doubt on this was james dwight dana in 1849
in his manual of geology 1863 dana says "the continents and oceans had their general outline or form defined in earliest time this has been proved with respect to north america from the position and distribution of the first beds of the silurian - those of the potsdam epoch and this will probably prove to the case in primordial time with the other continents also" dana was enormously influential in america - his manual of mineralogy is still in print in revised form - and the theory became known as permanence theory
this appeared to be confirmed by the exploration of the deep sea beds conducted by the challenger expedition 1872-6 which showed that contrary to expectation land debris brought down by rivers to the ocean is deposited comparatively close to the shore in what is now known as the continental shelf this suggested that the oceans were a permanent feature of the earth's surface and did not change places with the continents
=== wegener and his predecessors ===
the speculation that the american continents had once formed a single landmass with europe and asia before assuming the present shapes and positions was suggested by several scientists before alfred wegener's 1912 paper although wegener's theory was formed independently and was more complete than those of his predecessors wegener later credited a number of past authors with similar ideas: franklin coxworthy (between 1848 and 1890) roberto mantovani (between 1889 and 1909) william henry pickering (1907) and frank bursley taylor (1908) in addition eduard suess had proposed a supercontinent gondwana in 1885 and the tethys ocean in 1893 assuming a land-bridge between the present continents submerged in the form of a geosyncline and john perry had written an 1895 paper proposing that the earth's interior was fluid and disagreeing with lord kelvin on the age of the earth
for example: the similarity of southern continent geological formations had led roberto mantovani to conjecture in 1889 and 1909 that all the continents had once been joined into a supercontinent; wegener noted the similarity of mantovani's and his own maps of the former positions of the southern continents in mantovani's conjecture through volcanic activity due to thermal expansion this continent broke and the new continents drifted away from each other because of further expansion of the rip-zones where the oceans now lie this led mantovani to propose an expanding earth theory which has since been shown to be incorrect
continental drift without expansion was proposed by frank bursley taylor who suggested in 1908 (published in 1910) that the continents were moved into their present positions by a process of "continental creep." in a later paper he proposed that this occurred by their being dragged towards the equator by tidal forces during the hypothesized capture of the moon in the cretaceous resulting in "general crustal creep" toward the equator although his proposed mechanism was wrong he was the first to realize the insight that one of the effects of continental motion would be the formation of mountains and attributed the formation of the himalayas to the collision between the indian subcontinent with asia wegener said that of all those theories taylor's although not fully developed had the most similarities to his own in the mid-20th century the theory of continental drift was referred to as the "taylor-wegener hypothesis," although this terminology eventually fell out of common use
alfred wegener first presented his hypothesis that the continents had once formed a single landmass called pangea before breaking apart and drifting to their present locations to the german geological society on 6 january 1912
wegener was the first to use the phrase "continental drift" (1912 1915) (in german "die verschiebung der kontinente" translated into english in 1922) and formally publish the hypothesis that the continents had somehow "drifted" apart although he presented much evidence for continental drift he was unable to provide a convincing explanation for the physical processes which might have caused this drift his suggestion that the continents had been pulled apart by the centrifugal pseudoforce (polflucht) of the earth's rotation or by a small component of astronomical precession was rejected as calculations showed that the force was not sufficient the polflucht hypothesis was also studied by paul sophus epstein in 1920 and found to be implausible
=== rejection of wegener's theory 1910s1950s ===
the theory of continental drift was not accepted for many years one problem was that a plausible driving force was missing a second problem was that wegener's estimate of the velocity of continental motion 250 cm/year was implausibly high (the currently accepted rate for the separation of the americas from europe and africa is about 2.5 cm/year) and it did not help that wegener was not a geologist other geologists also believed that the evidence that wegener had provided was not sufficient it is now accepted that the plates carrying the continents do move across the earth's surface although not as fast as wegener believed; ironically one of the chief outstanding questions is the one wegener failed to resolve: what is the nature of the forces propelling the plates
the british geologist arthur holmes championed the theory of continental drift at a time when it was deeply unfashionable he proposed in 1931 that the earth's mantle contained convection cells that dissipated radioactive heat and moved the crust at the surface his principles of physical geology ending with a chapter on continental drift was published in 1944
david attenborough who attended university in the second half of the 1940s recounted an incident illustrating its lack of acceptance then: "i once asked one of my lecturers why he was not talking to us about continental drift and i was told sneeringly that if i could prove there was a force that could move continents then he might think about it the idea was moonshine i was informed."
geological maps of the time showed huge land bridges spanning the atlantic and indian oceans to account for the similarities of fauna and flora and the divisions of the asian continent in the permian era but failing to account for glaciation in india australia and south africa
as late as 1953 just five years before carey introduced the theory of plate tectonics the theory of continental drift was rejected by the physicist scheidegger on the following grounds
first it had been shown that floating masses on a rotating geoid would collect at the equator and stay there this would explain one but only one mountain building episode between any pair of continents; it failed to account for earlier orogenic episodes
second masses floating freely in a fluid substratum like icebergs in the ocean should be in isostatic equilibrium (in which the forces of gravity and buoyancy are in balance) but gravitational measurements showed that many areas are not in isostatic equilibrium
third there was the problem of why some parts of the earth's surface (crust) should have solidified while other parts were still fluid various attempts to explain this foundered on other difficulties
geophysicist jack oliver is credited with providing seismologic evidence supporting plate tectonics which encompassed and superseded continental drift with the article "seismology and the new global tectonics" published in 1968 using data collected from seismologic stations including those he set up in the south pacific
it is now known that there are two kinds of crust: continental crust and oceanic crust continental crust is inherently lighter and its composition is different from oceanic crust but both kinds reside above a much deeper "plastic" mantle oceanic crust is created at spreading centers and this along with subduction drives the system of plates in a chaotic manner resulting in continuous orogeny and areas of isostatic imbalance the theory of plate tectonics explains all this including the movement of the continents better than wegener's theory
== evidence of continental drift ==
evidence for the movement of continents on tectonic plates is now extensive similar plant and animal fossils are found around the shores of different continents suggesting that they were once joined the fossils of mesosaurus a freshwater reptile rather like a small crocodile found both in brazil and south africa are one example; another is the discovery of fossils of the land reptile lystrosaurus in rocks of the same age at locations in africa india and antarctica there is also living evidencethe same animals being found on two continents some earthworm families (e.g ocnerodrilidae acanthodrilidae octochaetidae) are found in south america and africa for instance
the complementary arrangement of the facing sides of south america and africa is obvious but is a temporary coincidence in millions of years slab pull and ridge-push and other forces of tectonophysics will further separate and rotate those two continents it was this temporary feature which inspired wegener to study what he defined as continental drift although he did not live to see his hypothesis generally accepted
widespread distribution of permo-carboniferous glacial sediments in south america africa madagascar arabia india antarctica and australia was one of the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift the continuity of glaciers inferred from oriented glacial striations and deposits called tillites suggested the existence of the supercontinent of gondwana which became a central element of the concept of continental drift striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles based on continents' current positions and orientations and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations as well as being contiguous with each other
