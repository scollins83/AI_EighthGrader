brawn is the name of several fictional characters from the various transformers universes all are tough autobots who turn into offroad vehicles brawn is not to be confused with x-brawn a very similar character from transformers: robots in disguise
== transformers: generation 1 ==
brawn is one of the strongest autobots in the transformers television and comic book series based on the popular toy line produced by takara and hasbro his vehicle mode is a land rover defender 4x4 brawn has not had a mass market release toy for several years and until recently the character has not been featured in the modern transformers universe
the original toy that became brawn was originally released by takara in 1983 as part of the micro change subset of the japanese microman line he was released in the us in 1984 by hasbro as one of the first assortment of american transformers toys
brawn's character biography describes him as one of the original eighteen autobots and very strong despite his small size he is further described as brave with physical strength that almost matches optimus prime able to lift weights of up to 190,000 lbs and strong enough to level a small building with a single punch his physical resilience is also high enough to resist artillery fire but he has an innate weakness to attacks based on electromagnetic waves brawn loves rugged and hostile environments and is always up to test his mettle against a new challenge
brawn's biography in marvel comics' 1986 transformers universe mini-series further expands on his character explaining that brawn is often teamed with bumblebee on missions due to their complementary skills and that while his never-say-die attitude improved the autobots' morale he is somewhat less than accepting of those less "tough" than him a fact made known by how badly he treated perceptor in the season 2 episode microbots [1]
though brawn's toy was not packaged with a weapon and his character biography doesn't specifically mention brawn carrying one the generation 1 animated series saw him equipped with a laser pistol
=== animated series ===
brawn (known as strongman (russian:  silach) in russia) was one of the autobots on the ark when it crashed into earth four million years ago he featured prominently in the series and was involved in many of the autobot and decepticon conflicts spanning the first two seasons of the transformers television series brawn had numerous roles during the first and second seasons despite his small size (the decepticons insult him by calling him 'midget') he is one of the strongest autobots; only optimus prime ironhide and the dinobots are equal or greater in strength on one occasion brawn singlehandedly saved prowl and bluestreak from starscream thundercracker and soundwave ("roll for it") on another he stopped megatron's use of a crystal powered superweapon in peru attacking and distracting the decepticon leader while optimus prime and skyfire destroyed the weapon ("fire in the mountain") when the decepticons brainwashed sparkplug witwicky and took him to cybertron brawn led the rescue mission and eventually managed to retrieve him ("the ultimate doom") singlehandedly taking down the rainmakers and soundwave by himself and holding his own against shockwave
later brawn developed a dislike of the scientist perceptor thinking him cowardly for preferring to study science than fight however after an adventure where they (along with bumblebee) were shrunk to go inside megatron's body to remove the heart of cybertron (a power source that was making megatron all-powerful) brawn admitted he'd been wrong after perceptor's knowledge proved invaluable in defeating the rampaging megatron ("microbots")
in the transformers: the movie set in the earth year 2005 brawn was assigned to moonbase one along with several first season autobots he was later assigned to make a special supply run to autobot city on earth during the shuttle mission decepticon forces invaded the shuttle using megatron in pistol mode starscream killed brawn with a single shot to the shoulder
brawn's death is disputed among fans although one of the strongest and toughest autobots in the movie he is rapidly dispensed by a single piercing shot to the shoulder his absence from the list of deceased autobots in "dark awakening" (replaced in a list of those killed in the shuttle attack with huffer) plus an appearance in the post-movie episode "carnage in c-minor" has inspired ongoing debate as to whether the character is truly dead the episode shows brawn a miscolored huffer and bonecrusher fighting together against a weapon built by galvatron this appearance is generally considered an error due to the episode being riddled with animation mistakes although select fans continue to argue brawn's survival in addition to the animation confirmation of his demise can be confirmed in the movie script [2] and comic book adaptations; all depict brawn being killed
a dispute can be made that brawn's injuries were more damaging than at first glance whenever brawn takes the shot to the shoulder after he falls it is noticed that a larger amount of brawns back is damaged thus giving the possibility that the laser fired could have acted as a hollow point like bullet and damaging more of brawn then previously thought
animators on the series would occasionally swell the ranks of the transformers with duplicates of certain characters (such as reflector in transport to oblivion and shockwave in five faces of darkness) duplicates intended to represent generic transformers it seems that the alternative brawn seen in carnage in c-minor might possibly have been one such duplicate along with huffer

==== marvel comics ====
brawn was one of the original autobot transformers making his first appearance in issue #1 of the original marvel comics transformers series in the initial four issue limited series produced by marvel brawn was part of primes elite crew that crash landed on earth throughout most of the series brawn remained more of a background character after the initial four issue arc

he was part of the autobot team led by goldbug to defeat the underbase powered starscream in san francisco brawn along with the other autobots was deactivated by starscream in issue #50
although brawn largely stayed in the background in the u.s comics in an early marvel u.k tale by simon furman he was pushed to the fore in the arc (the enemy within running from issues 13-17 of the u.k comic) brawn was depicted as becoming increasingly unstable due to a massive electric shock suffered during a technical experiment he finally snapped and beat sideswipe nearly to death brawn then went on the rampage wrecking a nearby town until the other autobots eventually managed to take him down brawn was repaired and returned to sanity by ratchet he elected to prove his loyalty by trial by combat pitted against starscream (who had been censured by the decepticons for open treachery) the decepticon won using his airborne form to stay out of brawn's reach before apparently destroying him in reality mirage had used his holographic powers to make it appear as if brawn had died and he returned to the autobot fold once again it is worth noting here that brawn's robot mode was portrayed as a likeness of his toy not as his more anthropomorphic portrayal in the animated series
in the us comics brawn and several other autobots were restored using nucleon by the autobot grimlock just before unicron attacked cybertron in issue 75 of the series brawn participated in the battle but was not seen again in the concluding issues of the original series although he did appear as one of the earthforce autobots in several later issues of the u.k comic
just before the launch of the marvel transformers: generation 2 comic brawn made a brief return to active duty as part of the autobot reinforcements on earth responding to megatrons alliance with cobra forces brawn was killed by megatron in the conflict as his body was atomized never again to return to the pages of marvel continuity - although he would return in the pages of "transformers: universe"
he also appeared in the u.k "space pirates" arc (set in the future of the movie) where he was killed during the quintesson attack on autobot city
