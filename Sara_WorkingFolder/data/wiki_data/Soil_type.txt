in terms of soil texture soil type usually refers to the different sizes of mineral particles in a particular sample soil is made up in part of finely ground rock particles grouped according to size as sand and silt in addition to clay organic material such as decomposed plant matter
each component and their size play an important role for example the largest particles sand determine aeration and drainage characteristics while the tiniest sub-microscopic clay particles are chemically active binding with water and plant nutrients the ratio of these sizes determines soil type: clay loam clay-loam silt-loam and so on
in addition to the mineral composition of soil humus (organic material) also plays an important role in soil characteristics and fertility for plant life soil may be mixed with larger aggregate such as pebbles or gravel not all types of soil are permeable such as pure clay
there are many recognized soil classifications both international and national
