a hormone (from greek  "impetus") is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour hormones have diverse chemical structures mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids steroids and amino acid derivatives (amines peptides and proteins) the glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system the term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling)
hormones are used to communicate between organs and tissues to regulate physiological and behavioral activities such as digestion metabolism respiration tissue function sensory perception sleep excretion lactation stress growth and development movement reproduction and mood hormones affect distant cells by binding to specific receptor proteins in the target cell resulting in a change in cell function when a hormone binds to the receptor it results in the activation of a signal transduction pathway this may lead to cell type-specific responses that include rapid non-genomic effects or slower genomic responses where the hormones acting through their receptors activate gene transcription resulting in increased expression of target proteins amino acidbased hormones (amines and peptide or protein hormones) are water-soluble and act on the surface of target cells via second messengers; steroid hormones being lipid-soluble move through the plasma membranes of target cells (both cytoplasmic and nuclear) to act within their nuclei
hormone synthesis may occur in specific tissues of endocrine glands or in other specialized cells hormone synthesis occurs in response to specific biochemical signals induced by a wide range of regulatory systems for instance ionized calcium concentration affects pth synthesis whereas glucose concentration affects insulin synthesis regulation of hormone synthesis of gonadal adrenal and thyroid hormones is often dependent on complex sets of direct influence and feedback interactions involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) -gonadal (hpg) and -thyroid (hpt) axes
upon secretion certain hormones including protein hormones and catecholamines are water-soluble and are thus readily transported through the circulatory system other hormones including steroid and thyroid hormones are lipid-soluble; to allow for their widespread distribution these hormones must bond to carrier plasma glycoproteins (e.g. thyroxine-binding globulin (tbg)) to form ligand-protein complexes some hormones are completely active when released into the bloodstream (as is the case for insulin and growth hormones) while others are prohormones that must be activated in specific cells through a series of activation steps that are commonly highly regulated the endocrine system secretes hormones directly into the bloodstream typically into fenestrated capillaries whereas the exocrine system secretes its hormones indirectly using ducts hormones with paracrine function diffuse through the interstitial spaces to nearby target tissue
== overviewedit ==
hormonal signaling involves the following steps:
biosynthesis of a particular hormone in a particular tissue
storage and secretion of the hormone
transport of the hormone to the target cell(s)
recognition of the hormone by an associated cell membrane or intracellular receptor protein
relay and amplification of the received hormonal signal via a signal transduction process: this then leads to a cellular response the reaction of the target cells may then be recognized by the original hormone-producing cells leading to a down-regulation in hormone production this is an example of a homeostatic negative feedback loop
breakdown of the hormone
hormone cells are typically of a specialized cell type residing within a particular endocrine gland such as the thyroid gland ovaries and testes hormones exit their cell of origin via exocytosis or another means of membrane transport the hierarchical model is an oversimplification of the hormonal signaling process cellular recipients of a particular hormonal signal may be one of several cell types that reside within a number of different tissues as is the case for insulin which triggers a diverse range of systemic physiological effects different tissue types may also respond differently to the same hormonal signal
== regulationedit ==
the rate of hormone biosynthesis and secretion is often regulated by a homeostatic negative feedback control mechanism such a mechanism depends on factors that influence the metabolism and excretion of hormones thus higher hormone concentration alone cannot trigger the negative feedback mechanism negative feedback must be triggered by overproduction of an "effect" of the hormone
hormone secretion can be stimulated and inhibited by:
other hormones (stimulating- or releasing -hormones)
plasma concentrations of ions or nutrients as well as binding globulins
neurons and mental activity
environmental changes e.g. of light or temperature
one special group of hormones is the tropic hormones that stimulate the hormone production of other endocrine glands for example thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) causes growth and increased activity of another endocrine gland the thyroid which increases output of thyroid hormones
to release active hormones quickly into the circulation hormone biosynthetic cells may produce and store biologically inactive hormones in the form of pre- or prohormones these can then be quickly converted into their active hormone form in response to a particular stimulus
eicosanoids are considered to act as local hormones
== receptorsedit ==
most hormones initiate a cellular response by initially binding to either cell membrane associated or intracellular receptors a cell may have several different receptor types that recognize the same hormone but activate different signal transduction pathways or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same biochemical pathway
receptors for most peptide as well as many eicosanoid hormones are embedded in the plasma membrane at the surface of the cell and the majority of these receptors belong to the g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) class of seven alpha helix transmembrane proteins the interaction of hormone and receptor typically triggers a cascade of secondary effects within the cytoplasm of the cell often involving phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of various other cytoplasmic proteins changes in ion channel permeability or increased concentrations of intracellular molecules that may act as secondary messengers (e.g. cyclic amp) some protein hormones also interact with intracellular receptors located in the cytoplasm or nucleus by an intracrine mechanism
for steroid or thyroid hormones their receptors are located inside the cell within the cytoplasm of the target cell these receptors belong to the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors to bind their receptors these hormones must first cross the cell membrane they can do so because they are lipid-soluble the combined hormone-receptor complex then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell where it binds to specific dna sequences regulating the expression of certain genes and thereby increasing the levels of the proteins encoded by these genes however it has been shown that not all steroid receptors are located inside the cell some are associated with the plasma membrane
== effectsedit ==
a variety of exogenous chemical compounds both natural and synthetic have hormone-like effects on both humans and wildlife their interference with the synthesis secretion transport binding action or elimination of natural hormones in the body can change the homeostasis reproduction development and/or behavior similar to endogenously produced hormones
hormones have the following effects on the body:
stimulation or inhibition of growth
wake-sleep cycle and other circadian rhythms
mood swings
induction or suppression of apoptosis (programmed cell death)
activation or inhibition of the immune system
regulation of metabolism
preparation of the body for mating fighting fleeing and other activity
preparation of the body for a new phase of life such as puberty parenting and menopause
control of the reproductive cycle
hunger cravings
sexual arousal
a hormone may also regulate the production and release of other hormones hormone signals control the internal environment of the body through homeostasis
== chemical classesedit ==
as hormones are defined functionally not structurally they may have diverse chemical structures hormones occur in multicellular organisms (plants animals fungi brown algae and red algae) these compounds occur also in unicellular organisms and may act as signaling molecules but there is no consensus if in this case they can be called hormones
=== animaledit ===
vertebrate hormones fall into four main chemical classes:
amino acid derived examples include melatonin and thyroxine
peptides polypeptides and proteins small peptide hormones include trh and vasopressin peptides composed of scores or hundreds of amino acids are referred to as proteins examples of protein hormones include insulin and growth hormone more complex protein hormones bear carbohydrate side-chains and are called glycoprotein hormones luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone are examples of glycoprotein hormones
eicosanoids hormones derive from lipids such as arachidonic acid lipoxins and prostaglandins
steroid examples of steroid hormones include the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone as well as the stress hormone cortisol
compared with vertebrate insects and crustaceans possess a number of structurally unusual hormones such as the juvenile hormone a sesquiterpenoid
=== plantedit ===
plant hormones include abscisic acid auxin cytokinin ethylene and gibberellin
== therapeutic useedit ==
many hormones and their analogues are used as medication the most commonly prescribed hormones are estrogens and progestogens (as methods of hormonal contraception and as hrt) thyroxine (as levothyroxine for hypothyroidism) and steroids (for autoimmune diseases and several respiratory disorders) insulin is used by many diabetics local preparations for use in otolaryngology often contain pharmacologic equivalents of adrenaline while steroid and vitamin d creams are used extensively in dermatological practice
a "pharmacologic dose" or "supraphysiological dose" of a hormone is a medical usage referring to an amount of a hormone far greater than naturally occurs in a healthy body the effects of pharmacologic doses of hormones may be different from responses to naturally occurring amounts and may be therapeutically useful though not without potentially adverse side effects an example is the ability of pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids to suppress inflammation
== hormone-behavior interactionsedit ==
at the neurological level behavior can be inferred based on: hormone concentrations; hormone-release patterns; the numbers and locations of hormone receptors; and the efficiency of hormone receptors for those involved in gene transcription not only do hormones influence behavior but also behavior and the environment influence hormones thus a feedback loop is formed for example behavior can affect hormones which in turn can affect behavior which in turn can affect hormones and so on
three broad stages of reasoning may be used when determining hormone-behavior interactions:
the frequency of occurrence of a hormonally dependent behavior should correspond to that of its hormonal source
a hormonally dependent behavior is not expected if the hormonal source (or its types of action) is non-existent
the reintroduction of a missing behaviorally dependent hormonal source (or its types of action) is expected to bring back the absent behavior
== comparison with neurotransmittersedit ==
there are various clear distinctions between hormones and neurotransmitters:
a hormone can perform functions over a larger spatial and temporal scale than can a neurotransmitter
hormonal signals can travel virtually anywhere in the circulatory system whereas neural signals are restricted to pre-existing nerve tracts
assuming the travel distance is equivalent neural signals can be transmitted much more quickly (in the range of milliseconds) than can hormonal signals (in the range of seconds minutes or hours) neural signals can be sent at speeds up to 100 meters per second
neural signalling is an all-or-nothing (digital) action whereas hormonal signalling is an action that can be continuously variable as dependent upon hormone concentration
