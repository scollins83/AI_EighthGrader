the bilateria /baltri/ or bilaterians are the animals with bilateral symmetry i.e. they have a front and a back end as well as an upside and downside and therefore a left and a right in contrast radially symmetrical animals like jellyfish have a topside and downside but no front and back
the bilateria are a major group of animals including the majority of phyla but not sponges cnidarians placozoans and ctenophores for the most part bilateral embryos are triploblastic having three germ layers: endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm nearly all are bilaterally symmetrical or approximately so; the most notable exception is the echinoderms which achieve near-radial symmetry as adults but are bilaterally symmetrical as larvae
except for a few phyla (i.e flatworms and gnathostomulids) bilaterians have complete digestive tracts with a separate mouth and anus some bilaterians lack body cavities (acoelomates i.e platyhelminthes gastrotricha and gnathostomulida) while others display primary body cavities (deriving from the blastocoel as pseudocoel) and/or secondary cavities (that appear de novo for example the coelom)
== evolution ==
the hypothetical most recent common ancestor of all bilateria is termed the "urbilaterian" the nature of the first bilaterian is a matter of debate one side suggests that acoelomates gave rise to the other groups (planuloid-aceloid hypothesis by graff metchnikoff hyman or salvini plawen) while the other poses that the first bilaterian was a coelomate organism and the main acoelomate phyla (flatworms and gastrotrichs) have lost body cavities secondarily (the archicoelomata hypothesis and its variations such as the gastrea by haeckel or sedgwick the bilaterosgastrea by jgersten or the trochaea by nielsen)
the first evidence of bilateria in the fossil record comes from trace fossils in ediacaran sediments and the first bona fide bilaterian fossil is kimberella dating to 555 million years ago earlier fossils are controversial; the fossil vernanimalcula may be the earliest known bilaterian but may also represent an infilled bubble fossil embryos are known from around the time of vernanimalcula (580 million years ago) but none of these have bilaterian affinities burrows believed to have been created by bilaterian life forms have been found in the tacuar formation of uruguay and are believed to be at least 585 million years old
== phylogeny ==
there are two main superphyla (main lineages) of bilateria the deuterostomes include the echinoderms hemichordates chordates and a few smaller phyla the protostomes include most of the rest such as arthropods annelids mollusks flatworms and so forth there are a number of differences most notably in how the embryo develops in particular the first opening of the embryo becomes the mouth in protostomes and the anus in deuterostomes many taxonomists now recognize at least two more superphyla among the protostomes ecdysozoa (molting animals) and lophotrochozoa (also referred to as spiralia) within the latter some researchers also recognize another superphylum platyzoa while others reject the platyzoa monophyly the arrow worms (chaetognatha) have proven particularly difficult to classify with some taxonomists placing them among the deuterostomes and others placing them among the protostomes the two most recent studies to address the question of chaetognath origins support protostome affinities
a modern (2011) consensus phylogeny for bilateria is shown below although the position of certain clades are still controversial and the tree has changed considerably between 2000 and 2010 nodes marked with * have received broad consensus a prominent alternative tree is championed by nielsen (2001)
