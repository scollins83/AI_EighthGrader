the lunar phase or phase of the moon is the shape of the illuminated (sunlit) portion of the moon as seen by an observer on earth the lunar phases change cyclically as the moon orbits the earth according to the changing positions of the moon and sun relative to the earth the moon and the earth are tidally locked therefore the same lunar surface always faces earth this face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the moon in its orbit therefore the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on earth can vary from about 100% (full moon) to 0% (new moon) the lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres each of the 4 lunar phases is roughly 7 days (~7.4 days) each but varies slightly due to lunar apogee and perigee aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as shoemaker all parts of the moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight followed by 14.77 days of "night" (the "dark side" of the moon is a reference to radio communication darkness not visible light darkness)
== phases of the moon ==
in western culture the four principal lunar phases are first quarter full moon third quarter (also known as last quarter) and new moon these are the instants when the moon's apparent geocentric celestial longitude minus the sun's apparent geocentric celestial longitude is 0 90 180 and 270 respectively each of these phases is roughly 7.38 days long but the durations vary slightly because the moon's orbit is slightly elliptical and thus its speed in orbit is not constant
the eight principal and intermediate phases are given the following names in sequential order:
when the sun and moon are aligned on the same side of the earth the moon is "new" and the side of the moon facing earth is not illuminated by the sun as the moon waxes (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from earth is increasing) the lunar phases progress through new moon crescent moon first-quarter moon gibbous moon and full moon the moon is then said to wane as it passes through the gibbous moon third-quarter moon crescent moon and back to new moon the terms "old moon" and "new moon" are interchangeable although new moon is more common half moon is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons while the term 'quarter' refers to the extent of the moon's cycle around the earth not its shape
when a sphere is illuminated on one hemisphere and viewed from a different angle the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape defined by the intersection of an ellipse and circle (where the major axis of the ellipse coincides with a diameter of the circle) if the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards origin: 13501400; middle english < latin gibbsus humped equivalent to gibb ( a ) hump + -sus -ous ) whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle then the shape will be a crescent when a crescent moon occurs the phenomenon of earthshine may be apparent where the night side of the moon faintly reflects light from the earth
in the northern hemisphere if the left side of the moon is dark then the light part is growing and the moon is referred to as waxing (moving toward a full moon) if the right side of the moon is dark then the light part is shrinking and the moon is referred to as waning (past full and moving toward a new moon) assuming that the viewer is in the northern hemisphere the right portion of the moon is the part that is always growing (i.e. if the right side is dark the moon is growing darker; if the right side is lit the moon is growing lighter) in the southern hemisphere the moon is observed from a perspective inverted to that of the northern hemisphere so the opposite sides appear to grow (wax) and shrink (wane)
the above descriptions of the lunar phases apply for observers at temperate or high latitudes on the earth observers in tropical latitudes see the moon with its terminator apparently horizontal during the morning and evening the crescent moon can open upward or downward with the "horns" of the crescent pointing up or down respectively when the sun appears above the moon in the sky the crescent opens downward; when the moon is above the sun the crescent opens upward the crescent moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the sun is below the horizon which implies that the moon must be above the sun and the crescent must open upward this is therefore the orientation in which the crescent moon is most often seen from the earth's tropics the waxing and waning crescents look very similar the waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening and the waning crescent in the east in the morning
when the moon as seen from earth is a narrow crescent the earth as seen from the moon is almost fully lit by the sun often the part of the moon that is not directly lit by the sun is sufficiently brightly lit by light reflected from the earth to be easily visible from earth this phenomenon is called "earthshine" and is sometimes picturesquely described as "the old moon in the new moon's arms"
non-western cultures may use a different number of moon phases for example traditional hawaiian culture has a total of 30 different moon phases
== calendar ==
the average calendrical month which is 112 of a solar year is about 30.44 days while the moon's phase (synodic) cycle repeats on average every 29.53 days therefore the timing of the moon's phases shifts by an average of almost one day for each successive month (lunar year=354 days.)
photographing the moon's phase every day for a month starting in the evening after sunset and repeating approximately 25 minutes later each successive day ending in the morning before sunrise would create a composite image like the example calendar from may 8 2005 to june 6 2005 here in the left there is no picture on may 20 since a picture would be taken before midnight on may 19 and after midnight on may 21 similarly on a calendar listing moon rise or set times some days will appear to be skipped when the moon rises just before midnight one night it will rise just after midnight the next (so too with setting) the 'skipped day' is just a calendar artifact and not the moon behaving strangely the moon has a predictable orbit every month
== calculating phase ==
each of the 4 lunar phases lasts approximately 7 days (~7.4 days) but varies slightly due to lunar apogee and perigee
the approximate age of the moon and hence the approximate phase can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon (such as january 1 1900 or august 11 1999) and reducing this modulo 29.530588853 (the length of a synodic month) the difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the julian day number of one from that of the other or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since december 31 1899 however this calculation assumes a perfectly circular orbit and therefore may be incorrect by several hours (it also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date); it is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing moon phase but specialist usage taking account of lunar apogee and perigee requires a more elaborate calculation
== effect of parallax ==
the earth subtends an angle of about two degrees when seen from the moon this means that an observer on earth who sees the moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about two degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the moon on the western horizon the moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day so if these observers were stationary they would see the phases of the moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day or four hours but in reality the observers are on the surface of the rotating earth so someone who sees the moon on the eastern horizon at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later this adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases they appear to occur more slowly when the moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon the moon appears to move jerkily and the phases do the same the amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours which is a small fraction of a month it does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the moon however it does affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases
== misconceptions ==
it might be expected that once every month when the moon passes between earth and the sun during a new moon its shadow would fall on earth causing a solar eclipse but this does not happen every month nor is it true that during every full moon the earth's shadow falls on the moon causing a lunar eclipse solar and lunar eclipses are not observed every month because the plane of the moon's orbit around the earth is tilted by about five degrees with respect to the plane of earth's orbit around the sun (the plane of the ecliptic) thus when new and full moons occur the moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the earth and sun although an eclipse can only occur when the moon is either new (solar) or full (lunar) it must also be positioned very near the intersection of earth's orbit plane about the sun and the moon's orbit plane about the earth (that is at one of its nodes) this happens about twice per year and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year most of these events are quite insignificant; major eclipses of the moon or sun are less frequent
