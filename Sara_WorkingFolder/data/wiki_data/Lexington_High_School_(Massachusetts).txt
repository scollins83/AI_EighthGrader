== senate ==
in the 1980s there was a movement to give students a bigger voice within the school soon enough a new school constitution was ratified creating a new school student/faculty senate the senate allots to the teachers and the students the power to make decisions about the implementation of policies within the school
the philosophy behind the creation of the senate (as quoted from the senate constitution) is as follows:
the senate is not without its checks and balances though the school principal has veto power over the decisions of the senate but the senate can choose to override the principal's veto with a three-fourths supermajority vote
the senate is made up of two elected groups namely staff representatives and student representatives the faculty representatives are chosen at large one representative for every ten high school staff with the stipulation that at least one representative is elected from each of the various departments student representatives are elected one representative for every 50 members of the student body the number of student representatives is determined annually based on current enrollment in grades 8-11 and then divided among the classes per the school constitution student representatives allotted to a class are elected by that class at large
up to five seats are open for students to represent under-represented groups said groups must petition the senate for such representation
the 1993 massachusetts education reform legislation makes institutions like the lhs senate an advisory body only but lhs principals since 1993 have continued to work with senate members to reach compromise legislation so the voice of the lhs senate will still shape school policy
