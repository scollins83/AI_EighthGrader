thymine /amn/ (t thy) is one of the four nucleobases in the nucleic acid of dna that are represented by the letters gcat the others are adenine guanine and cytosine thymine is also known as 5-methyluracil a pyrimidine nucleobase in rna thymine is replaced by the nucleobase uracil thymine was first isolated (from calves' thymus glands) in 1893 by albrecht kossel and albert neumann
== derivation ==
as the name suggests thymine may be derived by methylation of uracil at the 5th carbon in rna thymine is replaced with uracil in most cases in dna thymine (t) binds to adenine (a) via two hydrogen bonds thus stabilizing the nucleic acid structures
thymine combined with deoxyribose creates the nucleoside deoxythymidine which is synonymous with the term thymidine thymidine can be phosphorylated with one two or three phosphoric acid groups creating respectively tmp tdp or ttp (thymidine mono- di- or triphosphate)
one of the common mutations of dna involves two adjacent thymines or cytosine which in presence of ultraviolet light may form thymine dimers causing "kinks" in the dna molecule that inhibit normal function
thymine could also be a target for actions of 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) in cancer treatment 5-fu can be a metabolic analog of thymine (in dna synthesis) or uracil (in rna synthesis) substitution of this analog inhibits dna synthesis in actively dividing cells
thymine bases are frequently oxidized to hydantoins over time after the death of an organism
thymine is a nuclear base
== theoretical aspects ==
in march 2015 nasa scientists reported that for the first time complex dna and rna organic compounds of life including uracil cytosine and thymine have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions using starting chemicals such as pyrimidine found in meteorites pyrimidine like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds according to the scientists
