the mineral fork formation is a mapped proterozoic bedrock unit in utah
== description ==
granger et al (1952) describe the mineral fork formation as black tillite consisting of boulders cobbles and pebbles of quartzite limestone or granitic rocks in a black sandy matrix with dark-gray to black varved slate or shale dark-gray quartzite and occasional channel fillings of boulder conglomerate
=== exposures ===
according to yonkee et al (2000) the mineral fork is exposed at the following locations in utah:
antelope island
big cottonwood canyon
santaquin-provo
and also:
little cottonwood canyon
=== fossils ===
abundant microfossils of planktonic alga of bavlinella faveolata
== age ==
the presence of bavlinella faveolata in the formation indicates a likely age of 750650 ma because this fossil occurs elsewhere where it is well-dated radiometrically the mineral fork formation is no older than 1,250 ma and no younger than 540 ma thus it is likely neoproterozoic but possibly mesoproterozoic
