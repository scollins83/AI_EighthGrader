the seabed (also known as the seafloor sea floor or ocean floor) is the bottom of the ocean
== seabed structure ==
most of the oceans have a common structure created by common physical phenomena mainly from tectonic movement and sediment from various sources the structure of the oceans starting with the continents begins usually with a continental shelf continues to the continental slope which is a steep descent into the ocean until reaching the abyssal plain a topographic plain the beginning of the seabed and its main area the border between the continental slope and the abyssal plain usually has a more gradual descent and is called the continental rise which is caused by sediment cascading down the continental slope
the mid-ocean ridge as its name implies is a mountainous rise through the middle of all the oceans between the continents typically a rift runs along the edge of this ridge along tectonic plate edges there are typically oceanic trenches deep valleys created by the mantle circulation movement from the mid-ocean mountain ridge to the oceanic trench
hotspot volcanic island ridges are created by volcanic activity erupting periodically as the tectonic plates pass over a hotspot in areas with volcanic activity and in the oceanic trenches there are hydrothermal vents releasing high pressure and extremely hot water and chemicals into the typically freezing water around it
deep ocean water is divided into layers or zones each with typical features of salinity pressure temperature and marine life according to their depth lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the abyssal zone whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000 m (20,000 ft) the hadal zone which includes the oceanic trenches lies between 6,00011,000 metres (20,00036,000 ft) and is the deepest oceanic zone
=== technical terms ===
the acronym "mbsf" meaning "metres below the seafloor" is a convention used for depths below the seafloor
== benthos ==
benthos is the community of organisms which live on in or near the seabed the area known as the benthic zone this community lives in or near marine sedimentary environments from tidal pools along the foreshore out to the continental shelf and then down to the abyssal depths the benthic zone is the ecological region on in and immediately above the seabed including the sediment surface and some sub-surface layers benthos generally live in close relationship with the substrate bottom and many such organisms are permanently attached to the bottom the superficial layer of the soil lining the given body of water the benthic boundary layer is an integral part of the benthic zone and greatly influences the biological activity which takes place there examples of contact soil layers include sand bottoms rocky outcrops coral and bay mud
== seabed features ==
each area of the seabed has typical features such as common soil composition typical topography salinity of water layers above it marine life magnetic direction of rocks,and sedimenting
seabed topography is flat where sedimenting is heavy and covers the tectonic features sedimenting comes from various sources:
land erosion sediments brought mainly by rivers
new "young rock" new magma of basalt composition from the mid-ocean ridge
underwater volcanic ash spreading especially from hydrothermal vents
microorganism activity
sea currents eroding the seabed itself
marine life: corals fish algae crabs marine plants and other biological created sediment
where sedimenting is avoided such as in the atlantic ocean especially in the northern and eastern atlantic the original tectonic activity can be clearly seen as straight line "cracks" or "vents" thousands of kilometers long
recently there has been the discovery of abundant marine life in the deep sea especially around hydrothermal vents large deep sea communities of marine life have been discovered around black and white smokers hydrothermal vents emitting typical chemicals toxic to humans and most of the vertebrates this marine life receives its energy from both the extreme temperature difference (typically a drop of 150 degrees) and from chemosynthesis by bacteria
brine pools are another seabed feature usually connected to cold seeps
== history of exploration ==
the seabed has been explored by submersibles such as alvin and to some extent scuba divers with special equipment the process that continually adds new material to the ocean floor is seafloor spreading and the continental slope in recent years satellite images show a very clear mapping of the seabed and are used extensively in the study and exploration of the ocean floor
== in art and culture ==
some children's play songs include elements such as "there's a hole at the bottom of the sea" or "a sailor went to sea but all that he could see was the bottom of the deep blue sea"
on and under the seabed are archaeological sites of historic interest such as shipwrecks and sunken towns this underwater cultural heritage is protected by the unesco convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage the convention aims at preventing looting and the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information by providing an international legal framework
