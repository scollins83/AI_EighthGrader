== european chemistry congresses ==
the euchems chemistry congress is a biennial event beginning in 2006 with the first conference in budapest around 2300 participants from more than 50 countries attended the congress in 2008 the congress was held in turin and again more than 2000 chemists followed the invitation to italy now coming from more than 65 nations the 3rd euchems chemistry congress from august 29 to september 2 2010 was organized by the german chemical society on behalf of euchems and nrnberg was the hosting city
in 2012 the 4th euchems chemistry congress was held in prague where almost 1800 participants attended apart from the scientific side eycn organized the career days a satellite event aiming at furthering the careers of the young chemists the 5th euchems chemistry congress was organised by the turkish chemical society in istanbul between 31 august 2014 and the 4th of september 2014 the 6th euchems chemistry congress will take place in seville 11 to 15 september 2016
