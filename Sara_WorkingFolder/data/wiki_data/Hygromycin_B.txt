hygromycin b is an antibiotic produced by the bacterium streptomyces hygroscopicus it is an aminoglycoside that kills bacteria fungi and higher eukaryotic cells by inhibiting protein synthesis
== history ==
hygromycin b was originally developed in the 1950s for use with animals and is still added into swine and chicken feed as an anthelmintic or anti-worming agent (product name: hygromix) hygromycin b is produced by streptomyces hygroscopicus a bacterium isolated in 1953 from a soil sample resistance genes were discovered in the early 1980s
== mechanism of action ==
hygromycin is active against both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells it acts by inhibiting polypeptide synthesis it stabilizes the trna-ribosomal acceptor site thereby inhibiting translocation
== use in research ==
in the laboratory it is used for the selection and maintenance of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that contain the hygromycin resistance gene the resistance gene is a kinase that inactivates hygromycin b through phosphorylation since the discovery of hygromycin-resistance genes hygromycin b has become a standard selection antibiotic in gene transfer experiments in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells based on impurity monitor method four different kinds of impurities are discovered in commercial hygromycin b from different suppliers and toxicities of different impurities to the cell lines are described in the following external links
=== use in plant research ===
hygromycin resistance gene is frequently used as a selectable marker in research on plants in rice agrobacterium-mediated transformation system hygromycin is used at about 30-75 mg l1 with an average of 50 mg l1 the use of hygromycin at 50 mg l1 demonstrated highly toxic to non-transformed calli thus it can be efficiently used to select transformants
