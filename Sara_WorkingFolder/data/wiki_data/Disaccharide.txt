a disaccharide or biose is the carbohydrate which is formed when two monosaccharides (simple sugars) undergo a condensation reaction which involves the elimination of a small molecule such as water from the functional groups only like monosaccharides disaccharides are soluble in water three common references are sucrose lactose and maltose
"disaccharide" is one of the four chemical groupings of carbohydrates (monosaccharide disaccharide oligosaccharide and polysaccharide)
the most common types of disaccharidessucrose lactose and maltosehave twelve carbon atoms with the general formula c12h22o11 the differences in the disaccharides are due to atomic arrangements within the molecule
== classification ==
there are two different types of disaccharides:
reducing disaccharides in which one monosaccharide the reducing sugar still has a free hemiacetal unit; and non-reducing disaccharides in which the components bond through an acetal linkage between their anomeric centers and neither monosaccharide has a free hemiacetal unit cellobiose and maltose are examples of reducing disaccharides
sucrose and trehalose are examples of non-reducing disaccharides
== formation ==
disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides are joined together and a molecule of water is removed a process known as dehydration reaction for example; milk sugar (lactose) is made from glucose and galactose whereas the sugar from sugar cane and sugar beets (sucrose) is made from glucose and fructose maltose another notable disaccharide is made up of two glucose molecules the two monosaccharides are bonded via a dehydration reaction (also called a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis) that leads to the loss of a molecule of water and formation of a glycosidic bond
== properties ==
the glycosidic bond can be formed between any hydroxyl group on the component monosaccharide so even if both component sugars are the same (e.g. glucose) different bond combinations (regiochemistry) and stereochemistry (alpha- or beta-) result in disaccharides that are diastereoisomers with different chemical and physical properties
depending on the monosaccharide constituents disaccharides are sometimes crystalline sometimes water-soluble and sometimes sweet-tasting and sticky-feeling
== assimilation ==
digestion involves breakdown to the monosaccharides carbohydrate digestion
== common disaccharides ==
maltose cellobiose and chitobiose are hydrolysis products of the polysaccharides starch cellulose and chitin respectively
