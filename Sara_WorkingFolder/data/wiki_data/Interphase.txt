interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life while it is in here it's copying dna to prepare for mitosis interphase is the 'daily living' or metabolic phase of the cell in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them grows reads its dna and conducts other "normal" cell functions the majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase this phase was formerly called the resting phase however interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting; rather the cell is actively living and preparing for later cell division so the name was changed a common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis however since mitosis is the division of the nucleus prophase is actually the first stage
in interphase the cell gets itself ready for mitosis or meiosis somatic cells or normal diploid cells of the body go through mitosis in order to reproduce themselves through cell division whereas diploid germ cells (i.e. primary spermatocytes and primary oocytes) go through meiosis in order to create haploid gametes (i.e. sperm and ova) for the purpose of sexual reproduction chromosomes are copied
== stages of interphase ==
there are three stages of interphase with each phase ending when a cellular checkpoint checks the accuracy of the stage's completion before proceeding to the next the stages of interphase are:
g1 (gap 1) in which the cell grows and functions normally during this time a high amount of protein synthesis occurs and the cell grows (to about double its original size) - more organelles are produced the volume of cytoplasm increases and mitochondria and chloroplasts divide if the cell is not to divide again it will enter g0
synthesis (s) in which the cell duplicates its dna (via semiconservative replication)
g2 (gap 2) in which the cell resumes its growth in preparation for division
in addition some cells that do not divide often or ever enter a stage called g0 (gap zero) which is either a stage separate from interphase or an extended g1
the duration of time spent in interphase and in each stage of interphase is variable and depends on both the type of cell and the species of organism it belongs to most cells of adult mammals spend about 20 hours in interphase; this accounts for about 90% of the total time involved in cell division interphase includes g1 s and g2 phases mitosis and cytokinesis however are separate from interphase
== interphase within sequences of cellular processes ==
=== interphase and the cell cycle ===
when g2 is completed the cell enters a relatively brief period of nuclear and cellular division composed of mitosis and cytokinesis respectively after the successful completion of mitosis and cytokinesis both resulting daughter cells re-enter g1 of interphase
in the cell cycle interphase is preceded by telophase and cytokinesis of the m phase in alternative fashion interphase is sometimes interrupted by g0 phase which in some circumstances may then end and be followed by the remaining stages of interphase after the successful completion of the g2 checkpoint the final checkpoint in interphase the cell proceeds to prophase or in plants to preprophase which is the first stage of mitosis
g0 phase is viewed as either an extended g1 phase where the cell is neither dividing nor preparing to divide and or as a distinct quiescent stage which occurs outside of the cell cycle
=== interphase and other cellular processes ===
in gamete production interphase is succeeded by meiosis in programmed cell death interphase is followed or preempted by apoptosis
