not to be confused with ferrimagnetism; for an overview see magnetism
ferromagnetism is the basic mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets or are attracted to magnets in physics several different types of magnetism are distinguished ferromagnetism (including ferrimagnetism) is the strongest type: it is the only one that typically creates forces strong enough to be felt and is responsible for the common phenomena of magnetism in magnets encountered in everyday life substances respond weakly to magnetic fields with three other types of magnetism paramagnetism diamagnetism and antiferromagnetism but the forces are usually so weak that they can only be detected by sensitive instruments in a laboratory an everyday example of ferromagnetism is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door the attraction between a magnet and ferromagnetic material is "the quality of magnetism first apparent to the ancient world and to us today"
permanent magnets (materials that can be magnetized by an external magnetic field and remain magnetized after the external field is removed) are either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic as are other materials that are noticeably attracted to them only a few substances are ferromagnetic the common ones are iron nickel cobalt and most of their alloys some compounds of rare earth metals and a few naturally-occurring minerals such as lodestone
ferromagnetism is very important in industry and modern technology and is the basis for many electrical and electromechanical devices such as electromagnets electric motors generators transformers and magnetic storage such as tape recorders and hard disks
== history and distinction from ferrimagnetism ==
historically the term ferromagnetism was used for any material that could exhibit spontaneous magnetization: a net magnetic moment in the absence of an external magnetic field this general definition is still in common use more recently however different classes of spontaneous magnetization have been identified when there is more than one magnetic ion per primitive cell of the material leading to a stricter definition of "ferromagnetism" that is often used to distinguish it from ferrimagnetism in particular
a material is "ferromagnetic" in this narrower sense only if all of its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetization
if some of the magnetic ions subtract from the net magnetization (if they are partially anti-aligned) then the material is "ferrimagnetic"
if the moments of the aligned and anti-aligned ions balance completely so as to have zero net magnetization despite the magnetic ordering then it is an antiferromagnet
these alignment effects only occur at temperatures below a certain critical temperature called the curie temperature (for ferromagnets and ferrimagnets) or the nel temperature (for antiferromagnets)
among the first investigations of ferromagnetism are the pioneering works of aleksandr stoletov on measurement of the magnetic permeability of ferromagnetics known as the stoletov curve
== ferromagnetic materials ==
the table on the right lists a selection of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds along with the temperature above which they cease to exhibit spontaneous magnetization (see curie temperature)
ferromagnetism is a property not just of the chemical make-up of a material but of its crystalline structure and microstructure there are ferromagnetic metal alloys whose constituents are not themselves ferromagnetic called heusler alloys named after fritz heusler conversely there are non-magnetic alloys such as types of stainless steel composed almost exclusively of ferromagnetic metals
one can also make amorphous (non-crystalline) ferromagnetic metallic alloys by very rapid quenching (cooling) of a liquid alloy these have the advantage that their properties are nearly isotropic (not aligned along a crystal axis); this results in low coercivity low hysteresis loss high permeability and high electrical resistivity one such typical material is a transition metal-metalloid alloy made from about 80% transition metal (usually fe co or ni) and a metalloid component (b c si p or al) that lowers the melting point
a relatively new class of exceptionally strong ferromagnetic materials are the rare-earth magnets they contain lanthanide elements that are known for their ability to carry large magnetic moments in well-localized f-orbitals
=== actinide ferromagnets ===
a number of actinide compounds are ferromagnets at room temperature or exhibit ferromagnetism upon cooling pup is a paramagnet with cubic symmetry at room temperature but which undergoes a structural transition into a tetragonal state with ferromagnetic order when cooled below its tc = 125 k in its ferromagnetic state pup's easy axis is in the <100> direction
in npfe2 the easy axis is <111> above tc ~500 k npfe2 is also paramagnetic and cubic cooling below the curie temperature produces a rhombohedral distortion wherein the rhombohedral angle changes from 60 (cubic phase) to 60.53 an alternate description of this distortion is to consider the length c along the unique trigonal axis (after the distortion has begun) and a as the distance in the plane perpendicular to c in the cubic phase this reduces to = 1.00 below the curie temperature
which is the largest strain in any actinide compound npni2 undergoes a similar lattice distortion below tc = 32 k with a strain of (43 5) 104 npco2 is a ferrimagnet below 15 k
=== lithium gas ===
in 2009 a team of mit physicists demonstrated that a lithium gas cooled to less than one kelvin can exhibit ferromagnetism the team cooled fermionic lithium-6 to less than 150 billionths of one kelvin above absolute zero using infrared laser cooling this demonstration is the first time that ferromagnetism has been demonstrated in a gas
== explanation ==
the bohrvan leeuwen theorem discovered in the 1910s showed that classical physics theories are unable to account for any form of magnetism including ferromagnetism magnetism is now regarded as a purely quantum mechanical effect ferromagnetism arises due to two effects from quantum mechanics: spin and the pauli exclusion principle
=== origin of magnetism ===
one of the fundamental properties of an electron (besides that it carries charge) is that it has a magnetic dipole moment i.e. it behaves like a tiny magnet this dipole moment comes from the more fundamental property of the electron that it has quantum mechanical spin due to its quantum nature the spin of the electron can be in one of only two states; with the magnetic field either pointing "up" or "down" (for any choice of up and down) the spin of the electrons in atoms is the main source of ferromagnetism although there is also a contribution from the orbital angular momentum of the electron about the nucleus when these magnetic dipoles in a piece of matter are aligned (point in the same direction) their individually tiny magnetic fields add together to create a much larger macroscopic field
however materials made of atoms with filled electron shells have a total dipole moment of zero because every electron's magnetic moment is cancelled by the opposite moment of the second electron in the pair only atoms with partially filled shells (i.e. unpaired spins) can have a net magnetic moment so ferromagnetism only occurs in materials with partially filled shells because of hund's rules the first few electrons in a shell tend to have the same spin thereby increasing the total dipole moment
these unpaired dipoles (often called simply "spins" even though they also generally include angular momentum) tend to align in parallel to an external magnetic field an effect called paramagnetism ferromagnetism involves an additional phenomenon however: the dipoles tend to align spontaneously giving rise to a spontaneous magnetization even when there is no applied field
=== exchange interaction ===
when two nearby atoms have unpaired electrons whether the electron spins are parallel or antiparallel affects whether the electrons can share the same orbit as a result of the quantum mechanical effect called the exchange interaction this in turn affects the electron location and the coulomb (electrostatic) interaction and thus the energy difference between these states this energy difference can be orders of magnitude larger than the energy differences associated with the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction due to dipole orientation which tends to align the dipoles antiparallel as a result in ferromagnetic materials nearby spins tend to align in the same direction in certain doped semiconductor oxides rkky interactions have been shown to bring about periodic longer-range magnetic interactions a phenomenon of significance in the study of spintronic materials
the exchange interaction is related to the pauli exclusion principle which says that two electrons with the same spin cannot also have the same "position" therefore under certain conditions when the orbitals of the unpaired outer valence electrons from adjacent atoms overlap the distributions of their electric charge in space are farther apart when the electrons have parallel spins than when they have opposite spins this reduces the electrostatic energy of the electrons when their spins are parallel compared to their energy when the spins are anti-parallel so the parallel-spin state is more stable in simple terms the electrons which repel one another can move "further apart" by aligning their spins so the spins of these electrons tend to line up this difference in energy is called the exchange energy
the materials in which the exchange interaction is much stronger than the competing dipole-dipole interaction are frequently called magnetic materials for instance in iron (fe) the exchange force is about 1000 times stronger than the dipole interaction therefore below the curie temperature virtually all of the dipoles in a ferromagnetic material will be aligned the exchange interaction is also responsible for the other types of spontaneous ordering of atomic magnetic moments occurring in magnetic solids antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism there are different exchange interaction mechanisms which create the magnetism in different ferromagnetic ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic substances these mechanisms include direct exchange rkky exchange double exchange and superexchange
=== magnetic anisotropy ===
although the exchange interaction keeps spins aligned it does not align them in a particular direction without magnetic anisotropy the spins in a magnet randomly change direction in response to thermal fluctuations and the magnet is superparamagnetic there are several kinds of magnetic anisotropy the most common of which is magnetocrystalline anisotropy this is a dependence of the energy on the direction of magnetization relative to the crystallographic lattice another common source of anisotropy inverse magnetostriction is induced by internal strains single-domain magnets also can have a shape anisotropy due to the magnetostatic effects of the particle shape as the temperature of a magnet increases the anisotropy tends to decrease and there is often a blocking temperature at which a transition to superparamagnetism occurs
=== magnetic domains ===
the above would seem to suggest that every piece of ferromagnetic material should have a strong magnetic field since all the spins are aligned yet iron and other ferromagnets are often found in an "unmagnetized" state the reason for this is that a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material is divided into tiny regions called magnetic domains (also known as weiss domains) within each domain the spins are aligned but (if the bulk material is in its lowest energy configuration i.e unmagnetized) the spins of separate domains point in different directions and their magnetic fields cancel out so the object has no net large scale magnetic field
ferromagnetic materials spontaneously divide into magnetic domains because the exchange interaction is a short-range force so over long distances of many atoms the tendency of the magnetic dipoles to reduce their energy by orienting in opposite directions wins out if all the dipoles in a piece of ferromagnetic material are aligned parallel it creates a large magnetic field extending into the space around it this contains a lot of magnetostatic energy the material can reduce this energy by splitting into many domains pointing in different directions so the magnetic field is confined to small local fields in the material reducing the volume of the field the domains are separated by thin domain walls a number of molecules thick in which the direction of magnetization of the dipoles rotates smoothly from one domain's direction to the other
=== magnetized materials ===
thus a piece of iron in its lowest energy state ("unmagnetized") generally has little or no net magnetic field however if it is placed in a strong enough external magnetic field the domain walls will move reorienting the domains so more of the dipoles are aligned with the external field the domains will remain aligned when the external field is removed creating a magnetic field of their own extending into the space around the material thus creating a "permanent" magnet the domains do not go back to their original minimum energy configuration when the field is removed because the domain walls tend to become 'pinned' or 'snagged' on defects in the crystal lattice preserving their parallel orientation this is shown by the barkhausen effect: as the magnetizing field is changed the magnetization changes in thousands of tiny discontinuous jumps as the domain walls suddenly "snap" past defects
this magnetization as a function of the external field is described by a hysteresis curve although this state of aligned domains found in a piece of magnetized ferromagnetic material is not a minimal-energy configuration it is metastable and can persist for long periods as shown by samples of magnetite from the sea floor which have maintained their magnetization for millions of years
heating and then cooling (annealing) a magnetized material subjecting it to vibration by hammering it or applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field from a degaussing coil tends to release the domain walls from their pinned state and the domain boundaries tend to move back to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field thus demagnetizing the material
commercial magnets are made of "hard" magnetic materials with very large magnetic anisotropy such as alnico and hard ferrites with a very strong tendency for the magnetization to be pointed along one axis of the crystal the "easy axis" during manufacture the materials are subjected to various metallurgical processes in a powerful magnetic field which aligns the crystal grains so their "easy" axes of magnetization all point in the same direction thus the magnetization and the resulting magnetic field is "built in" to the crystal structure of the material making it very difficult to demagnetize
=== curie temperature ===
as the temperature increases thermal motion or entropy competes with the ferromagnetic tendency for dipoles to align when the temperature rises beyond a certain point called the curie temperature there is a second-order phase transition and the system can no longer maintain a spontaneous magnetization so its ability to be magnetized or attracted to a magnet disappears although it still responds paramagnetically to an external field below that temperature there is a spontaneous symmetry breaking and magnetic moments become aligned with their neighbors the curie temperature itself is a critical point where the magnetic susceptibility is theoretically infinite and although there is no net magnetization domain-like spin correlations fluctuate at all length scales
the study of ferromagnetic phase transitions especially via the simplified ising spin model had an important impact on the development of statistical physics there it was first clearly shown that mean field theory approaches failed to predict the correct behavior at the critical point (which was found to fall under a universality class that includes many other systems such as liquid-gas transitions) and had to be replaced by renormalization group theory
