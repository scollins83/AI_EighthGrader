the troposphere is the lowest portion of earth's atmosphere it contains approximately 75% of the atmosphere's mass and 99% of its water vapor and aerosols the average depth of the troposphere is approximately 17 km (11 mi) in the middle latitudes it is deeper in the tropics up to 20 km (12 mi) and shallower near the polar regions approximately 7 km (4.3 mi) in winter the lowest part of the troposphere where friction with the earth's surface influences air flow is the planetary boundary layer this layer is typically a few hundred meters to 2 km (1.2 mi) deep depending on the landform and time of day the border between the troposphere and stratosphere called the tropopause is a temperature inversion
the word troposphere derives from the greek: tropos for "change" reflecting the fact that turbulent mixing plays an important role in the troposphere's structure and behaviour most of the phenomena we associate with day-to-day weather occur in the troposphere
== pressure and temperature structureedit ==
=== compositionedit ===
the chemical composition of the troposphere is essentially uniform with the notable exception of water vapor the source of water vapor is at the surface through the processes of evaporation and transpiration furthermore the temperature of the troposphere decreases with height and saturation vapor pressure decreases strongly as temperature drops so the amount of water vapor that can exist in the atmosphere decreases strongly with height thus the proportion of water vapor is normally greatest near the surface and decreases with height
=== pressureedit ===
the pressure of the atmosphere is maximum at sea level and decreases with higher altitude this is because the atmosphere is very nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium so that the pressure is equal to the weight of air above a given point the change in pressure with height therefore can be equated to the density with this hydrostatic equation:
where:
gn is the standard gravity
is the density
z is the altitude
p is the pressure
r is the gas constant
t is the thermodynamic (absolute) temperature
m is the molar mass
since temperature in principle also depends on altitude one needs a second equation to determine the pressure as a function of height as discussed in the next section.*
=== temperatureedit ===
the temperature of the troposphere generally decreases as altitude increases the rate at which the temperature decreases  is called the environmental lapse rate (elr) the elr is nothing more than the difference in temperature between the surface and the tropopause divided by the height the reason for this temperature difference is that most absorption of the sun's energy occurs at the ground which then heats the lower levels of the atmosphere and the radiation of heat occurs at the top of the atmosphere cooling the earth this process maintaining the overall heat balance of the earth
as parcels of air in the atmosphere rise and fall they also undergo changes in temperature for reasons described below the rate of change of the temperature in the parcel may be less than or more than the elr when a parcel of air rises it expands because the pressure is lower at higher altitudes as the air parcel expands it pushes on the air around it doing work; but generally it does not gain heat in exchange from its environment because its thermal conductivity is low (such a process is called adiabatic) since the parcel does work and gains no heat it loses energy and so its temperature decreases (the reverse of course will be true for a sinking parcel of air.)
since the heat exchanged is related to the entropy change by  the equation governing the temperature as a function of height for a thoroughly mixed atmosphere is
where s is the entropy the rate at which temperature decreases with height under such conditions is called the adiabatic lapse rate
for dry air which is approximately an ideal gas we can proceed further the adiabatic equation for an ideal gas is
where is the heat capacity ratio (=7/5 for air) combining with the equation for the pressure one arrives at the dry adiabatic lapse rate
if the air contains water vapor then cooling of the air can cause the water to condense and the behavior is no longer that of an ideal gas if the air is at the saturated vapor pressure then the rate at which temperature drops with height is called the saturated adiabatic lapse rate more generally the actual rate at which the temperature drops with altitude is called the environmental lapse rate in the troposphere the average environmental lapse rate is a drop of about 6.5 c for every 1 km (1,000 meters) in increased height
the environmental lapse rate (the actual rate at which temperature drops with height ) is not usually equal to the adiabatic lapse rate (or correspondingly ) if the upper air is warmer than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate () then when a parcel of air rises and expands it will arrive at the new height at a lower temperature than its surroundings in this case the air parcel is denser than its surroundings so it sinks back to its original height and the air is stable against being lifted if on the contrary the upper air is cooler than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate then when the air parcel rises to its new height it will have a higher temperature and a lower density than its surroundings and will continue to accelerate upward
the troposphere is heated from below by latent heat longwave radiation and sensible heat surplus heating and vertical expansion of the troposphere occurs in the tropics at middle latitudes tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 15c at sea level to about -55c at the tropopause at the poles tropospheric temperature only decreases from an average of 0c at sea level to about -45c at the tropopause at the equator tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 20c at sea level to about -70 to -75c at the tropopause the troposphere is thinner at the poles and thicker at the equator the average thickness of the tropical tropopause is roughly 7 kilometers greater than the average tropopause thickness at the poles
=== tropopauseedit ===
the tropopause is the boundary region between the troposphere and the stratosphere
measuring the temperature change with height through the troposphere and the stratosphere identifies the location of the tropopause in the troposphere temperature decreases with altitude in the stratosphere however the temperature remains constant for a while and then increases with altitude the region of the atmosphere where the lapse rate changes from positive (in the troposphere) to negative (in the stratosphere) is defined as the tropopause thus the tropopause is an inversion layer and there is little mixing between the two layers of the atmosphere
== atmospheric flowedit ==
the flow of the atmosphere generally moves in a west to east direction this however can often become interrupted creating a more north to south or south to north flow these scenarios are often described in meteorology as zonal or meridional these terms however tend to be used in reference to localised areas of atmosphere (at a synoptic scale) a fuller explanation of the flow of atmosphere around the earth as a whole can be found in the three-cell model
=== zonal flowedit ===
a zonal flow regime is the meteorological term meaning that the general flow pattern is west to east along the earth's latitude lines with weak shortwaves embedded in the flow the use of the word "zone" refers to the flow being along the earth's latitudinal "zones" this pattern can buckle and thus become a meridional flow
=== meridional flowedit ===
when the zonal flow buckles the atmosphere can flow in a more longitudinal (or meridional) direction and thus the term "meridional flow" arises meridional flow patterns feature strong amplified troughs and ridges with more north-south flow in the general pattern than west-to-east flow
=== three-cell modeledit ===
the three cells model attempts to describe the actual flow of the earth's atmosphere as a whole it divides the earth into the tropical (hadley cell) mid latitude (ferrel cell) and polar (polar cell) regions dealing with energy flow and global circulation its fundamental principle is that of balance - the energy that the earth absorbs from the sun each year is equal to that which it loses back into space but this however is not a balance precisely maintained in each latitude due to the varying strength of the sun in each "cell" resulting from the tilt of the earth's axis in relation to its orbit it demonstrates that a pattern emerges to mirror that of the ocean - the tropics do not continue to get warmer because the atmosphere transports warm air poleward and cold air equatorward the effect of which appears to be that of heat and moisture distribution around the planet
== synoptic scale observations and conceptsedit ==
=== forcingedit ===
forcing is a term used by meteorologists to describe the situation where a change or an event in one part of the atmosphere causes a strengthening change in another part of the atmosphere it is usually used to describe connections between upper middle or lower levels (such as upper-level divergence causing lower level convergence in cyclone formation) but can sometimes also be used to describe such connections over distance rather than height alone in some respects teleconnections could be considered a type of forcing
=== divergence and convergenceedit ===
an area of convergence is one in which the total mass of air is increasing with time resulting in an increase in pressure at locations below the convergence level (recall that atmospheric pressure is just the total weight of air above a given point) divergence is the opposite of convergence - an area where the total mass of air is decreasing with time resulting in falling pressure in regions below the area of divergence where divergence is occurring in the upper atmosphere there will be air coming in to try to balance the net loss of mass (this is called the principle of mass conservation) and there is a resulting upward motion (positive vertical velocity) another way to state this is to say that regions of upper air divergence are conducive to lower level convergence cyclone formation and positive vertical velocity therefore identifying regions of upper air divergence is an important step in forecasting the formation of a surface low pressure area
