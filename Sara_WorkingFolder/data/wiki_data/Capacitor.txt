a capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field the forms of practical capacitors vary widely but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized) the conductors can be thin films foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte etc the nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity a dielectric can be glass ceramic plastic film air vacuum paper mica oxide layer etc capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices unlike a resistor an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy instead a capacitor stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field between its plates
when there is a potential difference across the conductors (e.g. when a capacitor is attached across a battery) an electric field develops across the dielectric causing positive charge +q to collect on one plate and negative charge q to collect on the other plate if a battery has been attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time no current can flow through the capacitor however if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor a displacement current can flow
an ideal capacitor is characterized by a single constant value its capacitance capacitance is defined as the ratio of the electric charge q on each conductor to the potential difference v between them the si unit of capacitance is the farad (f) which is equal to one coulomb per volt (1 c/v) typical capacitance values range from about 1 pf (1012 f) to about 1 mf (103 f)
the larger the surface area of the "plates" (conductors) and the narrower the gap between them the greater the capacitance is in practice the dielectric between the plates passes a small amount of leakage current and also has an electric field strength limit known as the breakdown voltage the conductors and leads introduce an undesired inductance and resistance
capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass in analog filter networks they smooth the output of power supplies in resonant circuits they tune radios to particular frequencies in electric power transmission systems they stabilize voltage and power flow
== history ==
in october 1745 ewald georg von kleist of pomerania germany found that charge could be stored by connecting a high-voltage electrostatic generator by a wire to a volume of water in a hand-held glass jar von kleist's hand and the water acted as conductors and the jar as a dielectric (although details of the mechanism were incorrectly identified at the time) von kleist found that touching the wire resulted in a powerful spark much more painful than that obtained from an electrostatic machine the following year the dutch physicist pieter van musschenbroek invented a similar capacitor which was named the leyden jar after the university of leiden where he worked he also was impressed by the power of the shock he received writing "i would not take a second shock for the kingdom of france."
daniel gralath was the first to combine several jars in parallel into a "battery" to increase the charge storage capacity benjamin franklin investigated the leyden jar and came to the conclusion that the charge was stored on the glass not in the water as others had assumed he also adopted the term "battery" (denoting the increasing of power with a row of similar units as in a battery of cannon) subsequently applied to clusters of electrochemical cells leyden jars were later made by coating the inside and outside of jars with metal foil leaving a space at the mouth to prevent arcing between the foils the earliest unit of capacitance was the jar equivalent to about 1.11 nanofarads
leyden jars or more powerful devices employing flat glass plates alternating with foil conductors were used exclusively up until about 1900 when the invention of wireless (radio) created a demand for standard capacitors and the steady move to higher frequencies required capacitors with lower inductance more compact construction methods began to be used such as a flexible dielectric sheet (like oiled paper) sandwiched between sheets of metal foil rolled or folded into a small package
early capacitors were also known as condensers a term that is still occasionally used today particularly in high power applications like automotive systems the term was first used for this purpose by alessandro volta in 1782 with reference to the device's ability to store a higher density of electric charge than a normal isolated conductor
since the beginning of the study of electricity non conductive materials like glass porcelain paper and mica have been used as insulators these materials some decades later were also well-suited for further use as the dielectric for the first capacitors paper capacitors made by sandwiching a strip of impregnated paper between strips of metal and rolling the result into a cylinder were commonly used in the late 19century; their manufacture started in 1876 and they were used from the early 20th century as decoupling capacitors in telecommunications (telephony) porcelain was the precursor in case of all capacitors now belonging to the family of ceramic capacitors even in the early years of marconi`s wireless transmitting apparatus porcelain capacitors were used for high voltage and high frequency application in the transmitters
on receiver side the smaller mica capacitors were used for resonant circuits mica dielectric capacitors were invented in 1909 by william dubilier prior to world war ii mica was the most common dielectric for capacitors in the united states see ceramic capacitor#history
charles pollak (born karol pollak) the inventor of aluminum electrolytic capacitors found out that that the oxide layer on an aluminum anode remained stable in a neutral or alkaline electrolyte even when the power was switched off in 1896 he filed a patent for an "electric liquid capacitor with aluminum electrodes" based on his idea of using the oxide layer in a polarized capacitor in combination with a neutral or slightly alkaline electrolyte see electrolytic capacitor#history
with the development of plastic materials by organic chemists during the second world war the capacitor industry began to replace paper with thinner polymer films one very early development in film capacitors was described in british patent 587,953 in 1944 see film capacitor#history
solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors were invented by bell laboratories in the early 1950s as a miniaturized and more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement their newly invented transistor see tantalum capacitor#history
last but not least the electric double-layer capacitor (now supercapacitors) were invented in 1957 h becker developed a "low voltage electrolytic capacitor with porous carbon electrodes" he believed that the energy was stored as a charge in the carbon pores used in his capacitor as in the pores of the etched foils of electrolytic capacitors because the double layer mechanism was not known by him at the time he wrote in the patent: "it is not known exactly what is taking place in the component if it is used for energy storage but it leads to an extremely high capacity" see supercapacitor#history
== theory of operation ==
=== overview ===
a capacitor consists of two conductors separated by a non-conductive region the non-conductive region is called the dielectric in simpler terms the dielectric is just an electrical insulator examples of dielectric media are glass air paper vacuum and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors a capacitor is assumed to be self-contained and isolated with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field the conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces and the dielectric develops an electric field in si units a capacitance of one farad means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device
an ideal capacitor is wholly characterized by a constant capacitance c defined as the ratio of charge q on each conductor to the voltage v between them:
because the conductors (or plates) are close together the opposite charges on the conductors attract one another due to their electric fields allowing the capacitor to store more charge for a given voltage than if the conductors were separated giving the capacitor a large capacitance
sometimes charge build-up affects the capacitor mechanically causing its capacitance to vary in this case capacitance is defined in terms of incremental changes:
=== hydraulic analogy ===
in the hydraulic analogy charge carriers flowing through a wire are analogous to water flowing through a pipe a capacitor is like a rubber membrane sealed inside a pipe water molecules cannot pass through the membrane but some water can move by stretching the membrane the analogy clarifies a few aspects of capacitors:
the current alters the charge on a capacitor just as the flow of water changes the position of the membrane more specifically the effect of an electric current is to increase the charge of one plate of the capacitor and decrease the charge of the other plate by an equal amount this is just as when water flow moves the rubber membrane it increases the amount of water on one side of the membrane and decreases the amount of water on the other side
the more a capacitor is charged the larger its voltage drop; i.e. the more it "pushes back" against the charging current this is analogous to the fact that the more a membrane is stretched the more it pushes back on the water
charge can flow "through" a capacitor even though no individual electron can get from one side to the other this is analogous to the fact that water can flow through the pipe even though no water molecule can pass through the rubber membrane of course the flow cannot continue in the same direction forever; the capacitor will experience dielectric breakdown and analogously the membrane will eventually break
the capacitance describes how much charge can be stored on one plate of a capacitor for a given "push" (voltage drop) a very stretchy flexible membrane corresponds to a higher capacitance than a stiff membrane
a charged-up capacitor is storing potential energy analogously to a stretched membrane
=== energy of electric field ===
work must be done by an external influence to "move" charge between the conductors in a capacitor when the external influence is removed the charge separation persists in the electric field and energy is stored to be released when the charge is allowed to return to its equilibrium position the work done in establishing the electric field and hence the amount of energy stored is
here q is the charge stored in the capacitor v is the voltage across the capacitor and c is the capacitance
in the case of a fluctuating voltage v(t) the stored energy also fluctuates and hence power must flow into or out of the capacitor this power can be found by taking the time derivative of the stored energy:
=== currentvoltage relation ===
the current i(t) through any component in an electric circuit is defined as the rate of flow of a charge q(t) passing through it but actual chargeselectronscannot pass through the dielectric layer of a capacitor rather one electron accumulates on the negative plate for each one that leaves the positive plate resulting in an electron depletion and consequent positive charge on one electrode that is equal and opposite to the accumulated negative charge on the other thus the charge on the electrodes is equal to the integral of the current as well as proportional to the voltage as discussed above as with any antiderivative a constant of integration is added to represent the initial voltage v(t0) this is the integral form of the capacitor equation:
taking the derivative of this and multiplying by c yields the derivative form:
the dual of the capacitor is the inductor which stores energy in a magnetic field rather than an electric field its current-voltage relation is obtained by exchanging current and voltage in the capacitor equations and replacing c with the inductance l
=== dc circuits ===
a series circuit containing only a resistor a capacitor a switch and a constant dc source of voltage v0 is known as a charging circuit if the capacitor is initially uncharged while the switch is open and the switch is closed at t0 it follows from kirchhoff's voltage law that
taking the derivative and multiplying by c gives a first-order differential equation:
at t = 0 the voltage across the capacitor is zero and the voltage across the resistor is v0 the initial current is then i(0) =v0/r with this assumption solving the differential equation yields
where 0 = rc is the time constant of the system as the capacitor reaches equilibrium with the source voltage the voltages across the resistor and the current through the entire circuit decay exponentially the case of discharging a charged capacitor likewise demonstrates exponential decay but with the initial capacitor voltage replacing v0 and the final voltage being zero
=== ac circuits ===
impedance the vector sum of reactance and resistance describes the phase difference and the ratio of amplitudes between sinusoidally varying voltage and sinusoidally varying current at a given frequency fourier analysis allows any signal to be constructed from a spectrum of frequencies whence the circuit's reaction to the various frequencies may be found the reactance and impedance of a capacitor are respectively
where j is the imaginary unit and is the angular frequency of the sinusoidal signal the j phase indicates that the ac voltage v = zi lags the ac current by 90: the positive current phase corresponds to increasing voltage as the capacitor charges; zero current corresponds to instantaneous constant voltage etc
impedance decreases with increasing capacitance and increasing frequency this implies that a higher-frequency signal or a larger capacitor results in a lower voltage amplitude per current amplitudean ac "short circuit" or ac coupling conversely for very low frequencies the reactance will be high so that a capacitor is nearly an open circuit in ac analysisthose frequencies have been "filtered out"
capacitors are different from resistors and inductors in that the impedance is inversely proportional to the defining characteristic; i.e. capacitance
a capacitor connected to a sinusoidal voltage source will cause a displacement current to flow through it in the case that the voltage source is v0cos(t) the displacement current can be expressed as:
at sin(t) = -1 the capacitor has a maximum (or peak) current whereby i0 = cv0 the ratio of peak voltage to peak current is due to capacitive reactance (denoted xc)
xc approaches zero as approaches infinity if xc approaches 0 the capacitor resembles a short wire that strongly passes current at high frequencies xc approaches infinity as approaches zero if xc approaches infinity the capacitor resembles an open circuit that poorly passes low frequencies
the current of the capacitor may be expressed in the form of cosines to better compare with the voltage of the source:
in this situation the current is out of phase with the voltage by +/2 radians or +90 degrees (i.e. the current will lead the voltage by 90)
=== laplace circuit analysis (s-domain) ===
when using the laplace transform in circuit analysis the impedance of an ideal capacitor with no initial charge is represented in the s domain by:
where
c is the capacitance and
s is the complex frequency
=== parallel-plate model ===
the simplest model capacitor consists of two thin parallel conductive plates separated by a dielectric with permittivity  this model may also be used to make qualitative predictions for other device geometries the plates are considered to extend uniformly over an area a and a charge density = q/a exists on their surface assuming that the length and width of the plates are much greater than their separation d the electric field near the centre of the device will be uniform with the magnitude e = / the voltage is defined as the line integral of the electric field between the plates
solving this for c = q/v reveals that capacitance increases with area of the plates and decreases as separation between plates increases
the capacitance is therefore greatest in devices made from materials with a high permittivity large plate area and small distance between plates
a parallel plate capacitor can only store a finite amount of energy before dielectric breakdown occurs the capacitor's dielectric material has a dielectric strength ud which sets the capacitor's breakdown voltage at v = vbd = udd the maximum energy that the capacitor can store is therefore
the maximum energy is a function of dielectric volume permittivity and dielectric strength changing the plate area and the separation between the plates while maintaining the same volume causes no change of the maximum amount of energy that the capacitor can store so long as the distance between plates remains much smaller than both the length and width of the plates in addition these equations assume that the electric field is entirely concentrated in the dielectric between the plates in reality there are fringing fields outside the dielectric for example between the sides of the capacitor plates which will increase the effective capacitance of the capacitor this is sometimes called parasitic capacitance for some simple capacitor geometries this additional capacitance term can be calculated analytically it becomes negligibly small when the ratios of plate width to separation and length to separation are large
=== networks ===
for capacitors in parallel
capacitors in a parallel configuration each have the same applied voltage their capacitances add up charge is apportioned among them by size using the schematic diagram to visualize parallel plates it is apparent that each capacitor contributes to the total surface area
for capacitors in series
connected in series the schematic diagram reveals that the separation distance,not the plate area adds up the capacitors each store instantaneous charge build-up equal to that of every other capacitor in the series the total voltage difference from end to end is apportioned to each capacitor according to the inverse of its capacitance the entire series acts as a capacitor smaller than any of its components
capacitors are combined in series to achieve a higher working voltage for example for smoothing a high voltage power supply the voltage ratings which are based on plate separation add up if capacitance and leakage currents for each capacitor are identical in such an application on occasion series strings are connected in parallel forming a matrix the goal is to maximize the energy storage of the network without overloading any capacitor for high-energy storage with capacitors in series some safety considerations must be applied to ensure one capacitor failing and leaking current will not apply too much voltage to the other series capacitors
series connection is also sometimes used to adapt polarized electrolytic capacitors for bipolar ac use see electrolytic capacitor#designing for reverse bias
voltage distribution in parallel-to-series networks
to model the distribution of voltages from a single charged capacitor connected in parallel to a chain of capacitors in series :
note: this is only correct if all capacitance values are equal
the power transferred in this arrangement is:
== non-ideal behavior ==
capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor equation in a number of ways some of these such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear or can be assumed to be linear and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor the usual methods of network analysis can then be applied in other cases such as with breakdown voltage the effect is non-linear and normal (i.e. linear) network analysis cannot be used the effect must be dealt with separately there is yet another group which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant such an example is temperature dependence finally combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance resistance or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation
=== breakdown voltage ===
above a particular electric field known as the dielectric strength eds the dielectric in a capacitor becomes conductive the voltage at which this occurs is called the breakdown voltage of the device and is given by the product of the dielectric strength and the separation between the conductors
the maximum energy that can be stored safely in a capacitor is limited by the breakdown voltage due to the scaling of capacitance and breakdown voltage with dielectric thickness all capacitors made with a particular dielectric have approximately equal maximum energy density to the extent that the dielectric dominates their volume
for air dielectric capacitors the breakdown field strength is of the order 2 to 5 mv/m; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 mv/m; for oil 15 to 25 mv/m; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric the dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kv as the voltage increases the dielectric must be thicker making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages the breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown once this starts to happen the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit the results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy
the usual breakdown route is that the field strength becomes large enough to pull electrons in the dielectric from their atoms thus causing conduction other scenarios are possible such as impurities in the dielectric and if the dielectric is of a crystalline nature imperfections in the crystal structure can result in an avalanche breakdown as seen in semi-conductor devices breakdown voltage is also affected by pressure humidity and temperature
=== equivalent circuit ===
an ideal capacitor only stores and releases electrical energy without dissipating any in reality all capacitors have imperfections within the capacitor's material that create resistance this is specified as the equivalent series resistance or esr of a component this adds a real component to the impedance:
as frequency approaches infinity the capacitive impedance (or reactance) approaches zero and the esr becomes significant as the reactance becomes negligible power dissipation approaches prms = vrms /resr
similarly to esr the capacitor's leads add equivalent series inductance or esl to the component this is usually significant only at relatively high frequencies as inductive reactance is positive and increases with frequency above a certain frequency capacitance will be canceled by inductance high-frequency engineering involves accounting for the inductance of all connections and components
if the conductors are separated by a material with a small conductivity rather than a perfect dielectric then a small leakage current flows directly between them the capacitor therefore has a finite parallel resistance and slowly discharges over time (time may vary greatly depending on the capacitor material and quality)
=== q factor ===
the quality factor (or q) of a capacitor is the ratio of its reactance to its resistance at a given frequency and is a measure of its efficiency the higher the q factor of the capacitor the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal lossless capacitor
the q factor of a capacitor can be found through the following formula:
where is angular frequency is the capacitance is the capacitive reactance and is the series resistance of the capacitor
=== ripple current ===
ripple current is the ac component of an applied source (often a switched-mode power supply) whose frequency may be constant or varying ripple current causes heat to be generated within the capacitor due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current flow across the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor the equivalent series resistance (esr) is the amount of internal series resistance one would add to a perfect capacitor to model this some types of capacitors primarily tantalum and aluminum electrolytic capacitors as well as some film capacitors have a specified rating value for maximum ripple current
tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte are limited by ripple current and generally have the highest esr ratings in the capacitor family exceeding their ripple limits can lead to shorts and burning parts
aluminum electrolytic capacitors the most common type of electrolytic suffer a shortening of life expectancy at higher ripple currents if ripple current exceeds the rated value of the capacitor it tends to result in explosive failure
ceramic capacitors generally have no ripple current limitation and have some of the lowest esr ratings
film capacitors have very low esr ratings but exceeding rated ripple current may cause degradation failures
=== capacitance instability ===
the capacitance of certain capacitors decreases as the component ages in ceramic capacitors this is caused by degradation of the dielectric the type of dielectric ambient operating and storage temperatures are the most significant aging factors while the operating voltage has a smaller effect the aging process may be reversed by heating the component above the curie point aging is fastest near the beginning of life of the component and the device stabilizes over time electrolytic capacitors age as the electrolyte evaporates in contrast with ceramic capacitors this occurs towards the end of life of the component
temperature dependence of capacitance is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm) per c it can usually be taken as a broadly linear function but can be noticeably non-linear at the temperature extremes the temperature coefficient can be either positive or negative sometimes even amongst different samples of the same type in other words the spread in the range of temperature coefficients can encompass zero
capacitors especially ceramic capacitors and older designs such as paper capacitors can absorb sound waves resulting in a microphonic effect vibration moves the plates causing the capacitance to vary in turn inducing ac current some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity the resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications potentially causing feedback or unintended recording in the reverse microphonic effect the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force moving them as a speaker this can generate audible sound but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte if any
=== current and voltage reversal ===
current reversal occurs when the current changes direction voltage reversal is the change of polarity in a circuit reversal is generally described as the percentage of the maximum rated voltage that reverses polarity in dc circuits this will usually be less than 100% (often in the range of 0 to 90%) whereas ac circuits experience 100% reversal
in dc circuits and pulsed circuits current and voltage reversal are affected by the damping of the system voltage reversal is encountered in rlc circuits that are under-damped the current and voltage reverse direction forming a harmonic oscillator between the inductance and capacitance the current and voltage will tend to oscillate and may reverse direction several times with each peak being lower than the previous until the system reaches an equilibrium this is often referred to as ringing in comparison critically damped or over-damped systems usually do not experience a voltage reversal reversal is also encountered in ac circuits where the peak current will be equal in each direction
for maximum life capacitors usually need to be able to handle the maximum amount of reversal that a system will experience an ac circuit will experience 100% voltage reversal while under-damped dc circuits will experience less than 100% reversal creates excess electric fields in the dielectric causes excess heating of both the dielectric and the conductors and can dramatically shorten the life expectancy of the capacitor reversal ratings will often affect the design considerations for the capacitor from the choice of dielectric materials and voltage ratings to the types of internal connections used
=== dielectric absorption ===
capacitors made with any type of dielectric material will show some level of "dielectric absorption" or "soakage" on discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric this effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits the level of absorption depends on many factors from design considerations to charging time since the absorption is a time-dependent process however the primary factor is the type of dielectric material capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit very high absorption while polystyrene or teflon allow very small levels of absorption in some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist such as in flashtubes television sets and defibrillators the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal a capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20% of its original charge over a period of several minutes allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous
=== leakage ===
leakage is equivalent to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used in many vacuum tube circuits interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage a leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube in power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red or current limiting resistors to overheat even fail similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers but owing to lower heat production and the use of modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare
=== electrolytic failure from disuse ===
aluminum electrolytic capacitors are conditioned when manufactured by applying a voltage sufficient to initiate the proper internal chemical state this state is maintained by regular use of the equipment in former times roughly around the 1980s if a system using electrolytic capacitors is unused for a long period of time it can lose its conditioning sometimes they fail with a short circuit when next operated
== capacitor types ==
practical capacitors are available commercially in many different forms the type of internal dielectric the structure of the plates and the device packaging all strongly affect the characteristics of the capacitor and its applications
values available range from very low (picofarad range; while arbitrarily low values are in principle possible stray (parasitic) capacitance in any circuit is the limiting factor) to about 5 kf supercapacitors
above approximately 1 microfarad electrolytic capacitors are usually used because of their small size and low cost compared with other types unless their relatively poor stability life and polarised nature make them unsuitable very high capacity supercapacitors use a porous carbon-based electrode material
=== dielectric materials ===
most types of capacitor include a dielectric spacer which increases their capacitance these dielectrics are most often insulators however low capacitance devices are available with a vacuum between their plates which allows extremely high voltage operation and low losses variable capacitors with their plates open to the atmosphere were commonly used in radio tuning circuits later designs use polymer foil dielectric between the moving and stationary plates with no significant air space between them
in order to maximise the charge that a capacitor can hold the dielectric material needs to have as high a permittivity as possible while also having as high a breakdown voltage as possible
several solid dielectrics are available including paper plastic glass mica and ceramic materials paper was used extensively in older devices and offers relatively high voltage performance however it is susceptible to water absorption and has been largely replaced by plastic film capacitors plastics offer better stability and ageing performance which makes them useful in timer circuits although they may be limited to low operating temperatures and frequencies ceramic capacitors are generally small cheap and useful for high frequency applications although their capacitance varies strongly with voltage and they age poorly they are broadly categorized as class 1 dielectrics which have predictable variation of capacitance with temperature or class 2 dielectrics which can operate at higher voltage glass and mica capacitors are extremely reliable stable and tolerant to high temperatures and voltages but are too expensive for most mainstream applications electrolytic capacitors and supercapacitors are used to store small and larger amounts of energy respectively ceramic capacitors are often used in resonators and parasitic capacitance occurs in circuits wherever the simple conductor-insulator-conductor structure is formed unintentionally by the configuration of the circuit layout
electrolytic capacitors use an aluminum or tantalum plate with an oxide dielectric layer the second electrode is a liquid electrolyte connected to the circuit by another foil plate electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance but suffer from poor tolerances high instability gradual loss of capacitance especially when subjected to heat and high leakage current poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte which is harmful to printed circuit boards the conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures which increases equivalent series resistance while widely used for power-supply conditioning poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications electrolytic capacitors will self-degrade if unused for a period (around a year) and when full power is applied may short circuit permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes (for instance in older equipment arcing in rectifier tubes) they can be restored before use (and damage) by gradually applying the operating voltage often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transformer to supply ac power unfortunately the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits such remedies may not be applicable to modern high-frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input
tantalum capacitors offer better frequency and temperature characteristics than aluminum but higher dielectric absorption and leakage
polymer capacitors (os-con oc-con ko ao) use solid conductive polymer (or polymerized organic semiconductor) as electrolyte and offer longer life and lower esr at higher cost than standard electrolytic capacitors
a feedthrough capacitor is a component that while not serving as its main use has capacitance and is used to conduct signals through a conductive sheet
several other types of capacitor are available for specialist applications supercapacitors store large amounts of energy supercapacitors made from carbon aerogel carbon nanotubes or highly porous electrode materials offer extremely high capacitance (up to 5 kf as of 2010) and can be used in some applications instead of rechargeable batteries alternating current capacitors are specifically designed to work on line (mains) voltage ac power circuits they are commonly used in electric motor circuits and are often designed to handle large currents so they tend to be physically large they are usually ruggedly packaged often in metal cases that can be easily grounded/earthed they also are designed with direct current breakdown voltages of at least five times the maximum ac voltage
=== structure ===
the arrangement of plates and dielectric has many variations depending on the desired ratings of the capacitor for small values of capacitance (microfarads and less) ceramic disks use metallic coatings with wire leads bonded to the coating larger values can be made by multiple stacks of plates and disks larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plastic these are rolled up to save space to reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates
the assembly is encased to prevent moisture entering the dielectric early radio equipment used a cardboard tube sealed with wax modern paper or film dielectric capacitors are dipped in a hard thermoplastic large capacitors for high-voltage use may have the roll form compressed to fit into a rectangular metal case with bolted terminals and bushings for connections the dielectric in larger capacitors is often impregnated with a liquid to improve its properties
capacitors may have their connecting leads arranged in many configurations for example axially or radially "axial" means that the leads are on a common axis typically the axis of the capacitor's cylindrical body the leads extend from opposite ends radial leads might more accurately be referred to as tandem; they are rarely actually aligned along radii of the body's circle so the term is inexact although universal the leads (until bent) are usually in planes parallel to that of the flat body of the capacitor and extend in the same direction; they are often parallel as manufactured
small cheap discoidal ceramic capacitors have existed since the 1930s and remain in widespread use since the 1980s surface mount packages for capacitors have been widely used these packages are extremely small and lack connecting leads allowing them to be soldered directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards surface mount components avoid undesirable high-frequency effects due to the leads and simplify automated assembly although manual handling is made difficult due to their small size
mechanically controlled variable capacitors allow the plate spacing to be adjusted for example by rotating or sliding a set of movable plates into alignment with a set of stationary plates low cost variable capacitors squeeze together alternating layers of aluminum and plastic with a screw electrical control of capacitance is achievable with varactors (or varicaps) which are reverse-biased semiconductor diodes whose depletion region width varies with applied voltage they are used in phase-locked loops amongst other applications
== capacitor markings ==
most capacitors have numbers printed on their bodies to indicate their electrical characteristics larger capacitors like electrolytics usually display the actual capacitance together with the unit (for example 220 f) smaller capacitors like ceramics however use a shorthand consisting of three numeric digits and a letter where the digits indicate the capacitance in pf (calculated as xy 10z for digits xyz) and the letter indicates the tolerance (j k or m for 5% 10% and 20% respectively)
additionally the capacitor may show its working voltage temperature and other relevant characteristics
for typographical reasons some manufacturers print "mf" on capacitors to indicate microfarads (f)
=== example ===
a capacitor with the text 473k 330v on its body has a capacitance of 47 103 pf = 47 nf (10%) with a working voltage of 330 v the working voltage of a capacitor is the highest voltage that can be applied across it without undue risk of breaking down the dielectric layer
== applications ==
=== energy storage ===
a capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit so it can be used like a temporary battery or like other types of rechargeable energy storage system capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries are being changed (this prevents loss of information in volatile memory.)
conventional capacitors provide less than 360 joules per kilogram of specific energy whereas a conventional alkaline battery has a density of 590 kj/kg
in car audio systems large capacitors store energy for the amplifier to use on demand also for a flash tube a capacitor is used to hold the high voltage
=== pulsed power and weapons ===
groups of large specially constructed low-inductance high-voltage capacitors (capacitor banks) are used to supply huge pulses of current for many pulsed power applications these include electromagnetic forming marx generators pulsed lasers (especially tea lasers) pulse forming networks radar fusion research and particle accelerators
large capacitor banks (reservoir) are used as energy sources for the exploding-bridgewire detonators or slapper detonators in nuclear weapons and other specialty weapons experimental work is under way using banks of capacitors as power sources for electromagnetic armour and electromagnetic railguns and coilguns
=== power conditioning ===
reservoir capacitors are used in power supplies where they smooth the output of a full or half wave rectifier they can also be used in charge pump circuits as the energy storage element in the generation of higher voltages than the input voltage
capacitors are connected in parallel with the power circuits of most electronic devices and larger systems (such as factories) to shunt away and conceal current fluctuations from the primary power source to provide a "clean" power supply for signal or control circuits audio equipment for example uses several capacitors in this way to shunt away power line hum before it gets into the signal circuitry the capacitors act as a local reserve for the dc power source and bypass ac currents from the power supply this is used in car audio applications when a stiffening capacitor compensates for the inductance and resistance of the leads to the lead-acid car battery
==== power factor correction ====
in electric power distribution capacitors are used for power factor correction such capacitors often come as three capacitors connected as a three phase load usually the values of these capacitors are given not in farads but rather as a reactive power in volt-amperes reactive (var) the purpose is to counteract inductive loading from devices like electric motors and transmission lines to make the load appear to be mostly resistive individual motor or lamp loads may have capacitors for power factor correction or larger sets of capacitors (usually with automatic switching devices) may be installed at a load center within a building or in a large utility substation
=== suppression and coupling ===
==== signal coupling ====
because capacitors pass ac but block dc signals (when charged up to the applied dc voltage) they are often used to separate the ac and dc components of a signal this method is known as ac coupling or "capacitive coupling" here a large value of capacitance whose value need not be accurately controlled but whose reactance is small at the signal frequency is employed
==== decoupling ====
a decoupling capacitor is a capacitor used to protect one part of a circuit from the effect of another for instance to suppress noise or transients noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor reducing the effect they have on the rest of the circuit it is most commonly used between the power supply and ground an alternative name is bypass capacitor as it is used to bypass the power supply or other high impedance component of a circuit
decoupling capacitors need not always be discrete components capacitors used in these applications may be built in to a printed circuit board between the various layers these are often referred to as embedded capacitors the layers in the board contributing to the capacitive properties also function as power and ground planes and have a dielectric in between them enabling them to operate as a parallel plate capacitor
==== high-pass and low-pass filters ====
==== noise suppression spikes and snubbers ====
when an inductive circuit is opened the current through the inductance collapses quickly creating a large voltage across the open circuit of the switch or relay if the inductance is large enough the energy will generate a spark causing the contact points to oxidize deteriorate or sometimes weld together or destroying a solid-state switch a snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems for instance similarly in smaller scale circuits the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (rfi) which a filter capacitor absorbs snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series to dissipate energy and minimize rfi such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package
capacitors are also used in parallel to interrupt units of a high-voltage circuit breaker in order to equally distribute the voltage between these units in this case they are called grading capacitors
in schematic diagrams a capacitor used primarily for dc charge storage is often drawn vertically in circuit diagrams with the lower more negative plate drawn as an arc the straight plate indicates the positive terminal of the device if it is polarized (see electrolytic capacitor)
=== motor starters ===
in single phase squirrel cage motors the primary winding within the motor housing is not capable of starting a rotational motion on the rotor but is capable of sustaining one to start the motor a secondary "start" winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current when the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle with respect to the primary (run) winding a rotating electric field is created the force of the rotational field is not constant but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning when the rotor comes close to operating speed a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor the start capacitor is typically mounted to the side of the motor housing these are called capacitor-start motors that have relatively high starting torque typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques
capacitor-run induction motors have a permanently connected phase-shifting capacitor in series with a second winding the motor is much like a two-phase induction motor
motor-starting capacitors are typically non-polarized electrolytic types while running capacitors are conventional paper or plastic film dielectric types
=== signal processing ===
the energy stored in a capacitor can be used to represent information either in binary form as in drams or in analogue form as in analog sampled filters and ccds capacitors can be used in analog circuits as components of integrators or more complex filters and in negative feedback loop stabilization signal processing circuits also use capacitors to integrate a current signal
==== tuned circuits ====
capacitors and inductors are applied together in tuned circuits to select information in particular frequency bands for example radio receivers rely on variable capacitors to tune the station frequency speakers use passive analog crossovers and analog equalizers use capacitors to select different audio bands
the resonant frequency f of a tuned circuit is a function of the inductance (l) and capacitance (c) in series and is given by:
where l is in henries and c is in farads
=== sensing ===
most capacitors are designed to maintain a fixed physical structure however various factors can change the structure of the capacitor and the resulting change in capacitance can be used to sense those factors
changing the dielectric:
the effects of varying the characteristics of the dielectric can be used for sensing purposes capacitors with an exposed and porous dielectric can be used to measure humidity in air capacitors are used to accurately measure the fuel level in airplanes; as the fuel covers more of a pair of plates the circuit capacitance increases squeezing the dielectric can change a capacitor at a few tens of bar pressure sufficiently that it can be used as a pressure sensor a selected but otherwise standard polymer dielectric capacitor when immersed in a compatible gas or liquid can work usefully as a very low cost pressure sensor up to many hundreds of bar
changing the distance between the plates:
capacitors with a flexible plate can be used to measure strain or pressure industrial pressure transmitters used for process control use pressure-sensing diaphragms which form a capacitor plate of an oscillator circuit capacitors are used as the sensor in condenser microphones where one plate is moved by air pressure relative to the fixed position of the other plate some accelerometers use mems capacitors etched on a chip to measure the magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector they are used to detect changes in acceleration in tilt sensors or to detect free fall as sensors triggering airbag deployment and in many other applications some fingerprint sensors use capacitors additionally a user can adjust the pitch of a theremin musical instrument by moving their hand since this changes the effective capacitance between the user's hand and the antenna
changing the effective area of the plates:
capacitive touch switches are now used on many consumer electronic products
=== oscillators ===
a capacitor can possess spring-like qualities in an oscillator circuit in the image example a capacitor acts to influence the biasing voltage at the npn transistor's base the resistance values of the voltage-divider resistors and the capacitance value of the capacitor together control the oscillatory frequency
=== producing light ===
a light-emitting capacitor is made from a dielectric that uses phosphorescence to produce light if one of the conductive plates is made with a transparent material the light will be visible light-emitting capacitors are used in the construction of electroluminescent panels for applications such as backlighting for laptop computers in this case the entire panel is a capacitor used for the purpose of generating light
== hazards and safety ==
the hazards posed by a capacitor are usually determined foremost by the amount of energy stored which is the cause of things like electrical burns or heart fibrillation factors such as voltage and chassis material are of secondary consideration which are more related to how easily a shock can be initiated rather than how much damage can occur
capacitors may retain a charge long after power is removed from a circuit; this charge can cause dangerous or even potentially fatal shocks or damage connected equipment for example even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera flash unit powered by a 1.5 volt aa battery has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts this is easily capable of delivering a shock service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors for instance using a brinkley stick capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed high-voltage capacitors are stored with the terminals shorted as protection from potentially dangerous voltages due to dielectric absorption or from transient voltages the capacitor may pick up from static charges or passing weather events
some old large oil-filled paper or plastic film capacitors contain polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) it is known that waste pcbs can leak into groundwater under landfills capacitors containing pcb were labelled as containing "askarel" and several other trade names pcb-filled paper capacitors are found in very old (pre-1975) fluorescent lamp ballasts and other applications
capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating or as they reach their normal end of life dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes the dielectric fluid resulting in case bulging rupture or even an explosion capacitors used in rf or sustained high-current applications can overheat especially in the center of the capacitor rolls capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit high voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft x-rays even during normal operation proper containment fusing and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards
high-voltage capacitors can benefit from a pre-charge to limit in-rush currents at power-up of high voltage direct current (hvdc) circuits this will extend the life of the component and may mitigate high-voltage hazards
