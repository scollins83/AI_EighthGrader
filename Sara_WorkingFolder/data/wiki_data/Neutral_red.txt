neutral red (toluylene red basic red 5 or c.i 50040) is a eurhodin dye used for staining in histology it stains lysosomes red it is used as a general stain in histology as a counterstain in combination with other dyes and for many staining methods together with janus green b it is used to stain embryonal tissues and supravital staining of blood can be used for staining golgi apparatus in cells and nissl granules in neurons
in microbiology it is used in the macconkey agar to differentiate bacteria for lactose fermentation
neutral red can be used as a vital stain live cells incorporate neutral red into their lysosomes as cells begin to die their ability to incorporate neutral red diminishes thus loss of neutral red uptake corresponds to loss of cell viability it is also used to stain cell cultures for plate titration of viruses
neutral red is added to some growth media for bacterial and cell cultures it usually is available as a chloride salt
