electric field intensity is defined as the strength of an electric field at any point in the space it is equal to the electric force per unit charge experienced by a test charge placed at that point the unit of measurement is the volt/meter or newton/coulomb this physical quantity has dimensions as mlt(-3)a(-1)
electric field intensity is defined as :-"the electric field intensity due to point charge at any point in the electric field is defined as the electrostatic force exerted by it on a unit positive charge placed at that point."
