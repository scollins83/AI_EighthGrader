an allele (uk /lil/ or us /lil/) or allel is one of a number of alternative forms of the same gene or same genetic locus sometimes different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits such as different pigmentation however most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation
most multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes; that is they are diploid these chromosomes are referred to as homologous chromosomes diploid organisms have one copy of each gene (and therefore one allele) on each chromosome if both alleles are the same they and the organism are homozygous with respect to that gene if the alleles are different they and the organism are heterozygous with respect to that gene
the word "allele" is a short form of allelomorph ("other form") which was used in the early days of genetics to describe variant forms of a gene detected as different phenotypes it derives from the greek prefix  allel meaning "reciprocal" or "each other" which itself is related to the greek adjective (allos; cognate with latin "alius") meaning "other"
== dominant and recessive alleles ==
in many cases genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as dominant or recessive according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the heterozygote most resembles where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes the allele involved is said to be dominant to the other which is said to be recessive to the former the degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci this type of interaction was first formally described by gregor mendel however many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by co-dominance and polygenic inheritance
the term "wild type" allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in "wild" populations of organisms such as fruit flies (drosophila melanogaster) such a "wild type" allele was historically regarded as dominant common and normal in contrast to "mutant" alleles regarded as recessive rare and frequently deleterious it was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the "wild type" allele at most gene loci and that any alternative "mutant" allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of "affected" individuals often as genetic diseases and more frequently in heterozygous form in "carriers" for the mutant allele it is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic with multiple alleles whose frequencies vary from population to population and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences
== multiple alleles ==
a population or species of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each locus among various individuals allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles (polymorphism) present or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population a null allele is a gene variant that lacks the gene's normal function because it either is not expressed or the expressed protein is inactive
for example at the gene locus for the abo blood type carbohydrate antigens in humans classical genetics recognizes three alleles ia ib and i that determine compatibility of blood transfusions any individual has one of six possible genotypes (iaia iai ibib ibi iaib and ii) that produce one of four possible phenotypes: "type a" (produced by iaia homozygous and iai heterozygous genotypes) "type b" (produced by ibib homozygous and ibi heterozygous genotypes) "type ab" produced by iaib heterozygous genotype and "type o" produced by ii homozygous genotype it is now known that each of the a b and o alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different dna sequences that produce proteins with identical properties: more than 70 alleles are known at the abo locus an individual with "type a" blood may be an ao heterozygote an aa homozygote or an aa heterozygote with two different "a" alleles
== allele and genotype frequencies ==
the frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes (see hardy-weinberg principle) for a simple model with two alleles:
where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the alternative allele which necessarily sum to unity then p2 is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele 2pq is the fraction of heterozygotes and q2 is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele if the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is p2 + 2pq and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is q2
with three alleles:
and
in the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus the number of possible genotypes (g) with a number of alleles (a) is given by the expression:
== allelic dominance in genetic disorders ==
a number of genetic disorders are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait recessive genetic disorders include albinism cystic fibrosis galactosemia phenylketonuria (pku) and tay-sachs disease other disorders are also due to recessive alleles but because the gene locus is located on the x chromosome so that males have only one copy (that is they are hemizygous) they are more frequent in males than in females examples include red-green color blindness and fragile x syndrome
other disorders such as huntington disease occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele
