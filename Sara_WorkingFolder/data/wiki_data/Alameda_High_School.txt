== history ==
it was at the alameda board of education meeting held on march 6 1874 that the suggestion to open a preparatory department of a high school' was first presented on april 17 1874 c y johns was elected the first principal classes began with 52 students in july 1874 in a rented room over a drugstore on park street known as "boehmer's hall" the building still exists today as the china house restaurant
boehmer's hall was only temporary already a new building was being built on a site on santa clara at chestnut completed and occupied in 1875 the high school shared space with the grammar department in what became known as haight school' a site still occupied by this school today the class of 1878 totalling nine students was the first to graduate from alameda high school
it wasn't long before the number of students enrolled in the high school outgrew the space available at haight temporary quarters were located at the porter school located on alameda avenue by 1900 a campaign was started for a new separate high school building
with the help of the high school student body a bond was passed in the city for the new school the cornerstone was laid in 1902 on the new site at central and walnut the building was dedicated in 1903 and occupied in time for the december 1903 term
continued growth in enrollment required an even larger campus in 1925 a new bond issue was voted on the new school dedicated in 1926 comprised three connected buildings including the original 1903 structure which was refurbished to blend with the architectural style of the other two the architecture designed by local architect carl werner is early-twentieth-century neo-classical revival in nature evoking images of ancient greek temples with ionic columns in front of the kofman auditorium a facility known throughout the bay area as one of the best of the local playhouses
by 1955 the old building' had outlived its usefulness and was replaced with what became known as the new building' by subsequent students until 1977
campaigns to replace old public buildings with newer earthquake-safe structures led to the construction of the newest high school building across the street from the established campus on encinal at walnut
original plans involved tearing down the 1926 buildings and replacing them with a sports complex the only building to be kept being the new building' of 1955 a dedicated group of alumni and citizens saved the venerable buildings and the planned new construction was scaled back to what exists today
the newest building was first occupied in 1978 and included the site of the former porter school the west wing now houses language and fine arts as well as the frederick l chacon little theater the school was made an alameda historical monument in 1976 and listed in the national register of historic places in 1977
