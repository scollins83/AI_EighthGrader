a supervolcano is any volcano capable of producing a volcanic eruption with an ejecta mass greater than 1015 kg supervolcanoes can occur when magma in the mantle rises into the crust from a hotspot but is unable to break through the crust and pressure builds in a large and growing magma pool until the crust is unable to contain the pressure (this is the case for the yellowstone caldera) they can also form at convergent plate boundaries (for example toba) large igneous provinces can cover huge areas with lava and volcanic ash causing long-lasting climate change (such as the triggering of a small ice age or global warming) which can threaten species with extinction
== terminology ==
the origin of the term "supervolcano" is linked to an early 20th-century scientific debate about the geological history and features of the three sisters volcanic region of oregon in the united states in 1925 edwin t hodge suggested that a very large volcano which he named mount multnomah had existed in that region he believed that several peaks in the three sisters area are the remnants left after mount multnomah had been largely destroyed by violent volcanic explosions similar to mount mazama in 1948 the possible existence of mount multnomah was ignored by volcanologist howel williams in his book the ancient volcanoes of oregon the book was reviewed in 1949 by another volcanologist f m byers jr in the review byers refers to mount multnomah as a supervolcano although hodge's suggestion that mount multnomah is a supervolcano was rejected long ago the term "supervolcano" was popularised by the bbc popular science television program horizon in 2000 to refer to eruptions that produce extremely large amounts of ejecta
volcanologists and geologists do not refer to "supervolcanoes" in their scientific work since this is a blanket term that can be applied to a number of different geological settings since about 2000 however the term has been used by professionals for communicating science to the public the term megacaldera is sometimes used for caldera supervolcanoes such as the blake river megacaldera complex in the abitibi greenstone belt of ontario and quebec canada eruptions that rate vei 8 are termed "super eruptions" though there is no well-defined minimum explosive size for a "supervolcano" there are at least two types of volcanic eruptions that have been identified as supervolcanoes: large igneous provinces and massive eruptions
== large igneous provinces ==
large igneous provinces (lip) such as iceland the siberian traps deccan traps and the ontong java plateau are extensive regions of basalts on a continental scale resulting from flood basalt eruptions when created these regions often occupy several thousand square kilometres and have volumes on the order of millions of cubic kilometers in most cases the lavas are normally laid down over several million years they release large amounts of gases the runion hotspot produced the deccan traps about 66 million years ago coincident with the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event the scientific consensus is that a meteor impact was the cause of the extinction event but the volcanic activity may have caused environmental stresses on extant species up to the cretaceouspaleogene boundary additionally the largest flood basalt event (the siberian traps) occurred around 250 million years ago and was coincident with the largest mass extinction in history the permiantriassic extinction event although it is also unknown whether it was completely responsible for the extinction event
such outpourings are not explosive though lava fountains may occur many volcanologists consider that iceland may be a lip that is currently being formed the last major outpouring occurred in 178384 from the laki fissure which is approximately 40 km (25 mi) long an estimated 14 km3 (3.4 cu mi) of basaltic lava was poured out during the eruption
the ontong java plateau now has an area of about 2,000,000 km2 (770,000 sq mi) and the province was at least 50% larger before the manihiki and hikurangi plateaus broke away
== massive explosive eruptions ==
volcanic eruptions are classified using the volcanic explosivity index or vei it is a logarithmic scale which means that an increase of one in vei number is equivalent to a tenfold increase in volume of erupted material vei 7 or vei 8 eruptions are so powerful that they often form circular calderas rather than cones because the downward withdrawal of magma causes the overlying rock mass to collapse into the empty magma chamber beneath it
vei 9 despite some claims there are no explosive eruptions known to volcanologists that are confirmed to have attained a vei of 9 to do so the eruption would have to release the dense rock equivalent (dre) of at least 10,000 km3 (2,400 cu mi) of ejecta there are no known deposits of this volume that can be attributed to any single eruption
vei 8 eruptions are colossal events that throw out at least 1,000 km3 (240 cu mi) bulk volume
vei 7 events eject bulk volume at least 100 km3 (24 cu mi)
vei 6 eruptions occurred at krakatoa in 1883 and mount pinatubo in 1991 these eruptions ejected ~10 and 25 km3 (2.4 and 6.0 cu mi) bulk volume respectively at krakatoa the dutch colonial authorities claimed that the death toll was 36,417 but other estimates consider that the death toll is in excess of 120,000
the 1980 mount st helens eruption was a vei 5 eruption with 1.2 km3 (0.29 cu mi) bulk volume of ejecta
=== known supereruptions ===
==== vei 9 ====
the eight eruptions at the paran and etendeka traps during the cretaceous period when taken together were well over 15,000 km and may have been a single event that was the largest explosion during the phanerozoic eon but there have been no confirmed vei 9 eruptions
==== vei 8 ====
based on incomplete statistics at least 60 vei 8 eruptions have been identified
==== vei 7 ====
vei 7 eruptions less colossal but still supermassive have occurred in historical times the only ones in the past 2,000 years are tambora in 1815 taupo volcano's hatepe eruption c 232 baekdu mountain in 94647 and the eruption of mount samalas in 1257
* means dre (dense rock equivalent)
== media portrayal ==
in 2004 naked science tv show aired supervolcano on national geographic channel
in 2005 a two-part television docudrama called supervolcano aired on bbc one the discovery channel and other television networks worldwide
nova featured an episode "mystery of the megavolcano" in september 2006 examining such eruptions in the last 100,000 years
in 2006 the sci fi channel aired the documentary countdown to doomsday which featured a segment called "supervolcano" the same year abc news aired the documentary last days on earth which featured a segment called "supervolcano"
also in 2006 the syfy channel series stargate atlantis episode entitled "inferno" featured a supervolcano as the major plot device dr rodney mckay one of the main characters uses yellowstone national park to describe what a supervolcano is
in the episode "humanity" of the television drama young justice the team must relieve the pressure of the yellowstone caldera supervolcano caused by red volcano before an eruption with the potential for mass extinction takes place
in 2009 the apocalypse-themed film 2012 featured the super-eruption of the massive yellowstone caldera a result of the earth's core heating up this made most of the united states uninhabitable
in 2010 the syfy series warehouse 13 featured an episode entitled reset in which a supervolcano specifically the yellowstone caldera plays an important role
in december 2011 author harry turtledove published supervolcano: eruption the first of a planned four-novel series about events leading up to and following a fictional eruption of the yellowstone caldera the second book in the series supervolcano: all fall down was published in december 2012 the third book supervolcano: things fall apart was published in december 2013
at the end of terry pratchett and stephen baxter's novel long war the yellowstone caldera erupts the aftermath will be featured in the next volume long mars
the siberian traps and lake toba made an appearance in animal planet's prehistoric documentary animal armageddon (each in one episode) where speculation of the lifeforms they afflicted were brought to life
