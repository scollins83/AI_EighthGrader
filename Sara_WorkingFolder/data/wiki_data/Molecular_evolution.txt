molecular evolution is a change in the sequence composition of cellular molecules such as dna rna and proteins across generations the field of molecular evolution uses principles of evolutionary biology and population genetics to explain patterns in these changes major topics in molecular evolution concern the rates and impacts of single nucleotide changes neutral evolution vs natural selection origins of new genes the genetic nature of complex traits the genetic basis of speciation evolution of development and ways that evolutionary forces influence genomic and phenotypic changes
== forces in molecular evolution ==
the content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome novel genetic variants will arise through mutation and will spread and be maintained in populations due to genetic drift or natural selection
=== mutation ===
mutations are permanent transmissible changes to the genetic material (dna or rna) of a cell or virus mutations result from errors in dna replication during cell division and by exposure to radiation chemicals and other environmental stressors or viruses and transposable elements most mutations that occur are single nucleotide polymorphisms which modify single bases of the dna sequence other types of mutations modify larger segments of dna and can cause duplications insertions deletions inversions and translocations
most organisms display a strong bias in the types of mutations that occur with strong influence in gc-content transitions (a g or c t) are more common than transversions (purine pyrimidine) and are less likely to alter amino acid sequences of proteins
mutations are stochastic and typically occur randomly across genes mutation rates for single nucleotide sites for most organisms are very low roughly 109 to 108 per site per generation though some viruses have higher mutation rates on the order of 106 per site per generation among these mutations some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection
because mutations are extremely rare they accumulate very slowly across generations while the number of mutations which appears in any single generation may vary over very long time periods they will appear to accumulate at a regular pace using the mutation rate per generation and the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences divergence times can be estimated effectively via the molecular clock
=== recombination ===
recombination is a process that results in genetic exchange between chromosomes or chromosomal regions recombination counteracts physical linkage between adjacent genes thereby reducing genetic hitchhiking the resulting independent inheritance of genes results in more efficient selection meaning that regions with higher recombination will harbor fewer detrimental mutations more selectively favored variants and fewer errors in replication and repair recombination can also generate particular types of mutations if chromosomes are misaligned
==== gene conversion ====
gene conversion is a type of recombination that is the product of dna repair where nucleotide damage is corrected using orthologous genomic regions as a template damaged bases are first excised the damaged strand is then aligned with an undamaged homolog and dna synthesis repairs the excised region using the undamaged strand as a guide gene conversion is often responsible for homogenizing sequence of duplicate genes over long time periods reducing nucleotide divergence
=== genetic drift ===
genetic drift is the change of allele frequencies from one generation to the next due to stochastic effects of random sampling in finite populations some existing variants have no effect on fitness and may increase or decrease in frequency simply due to chance "nearly neutral" variants whose selection coefficient is close to a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size will also be affected by chance as well as by selection and mutation many genomic features have been ascribed to accumulation of nearly neutral detrimental mutations as a result of small effective population sizes with a smaller effective population size a larger variety of mutations will behave as if they are neutral due to inefficiency of selection
=== selection ===
selection occurs when organisms with greater fitness i.e greater ability to survive or reproduce are favored in subsequent generations thereby increasing the instance of underlying genetic variants in a population selection can be the product of natural selection artificial selection or sexual selection natural selection is any selective process that occurs due to the fitness of an organism to its environment in contrast sexual selection is a product of mate choice and can favor the spread of genetic variants which act counter to natural selection but increase desirability to the opposite sex or increase mating success artificial selection also known as selective breeding is imposed by an outside entity typically humans in order to increase the frequency of desired traits
the principles of population genetics apply similarly to all types of selection though in fact each may produce distinct effects due to clustering of genes with different functions in different parts of the genome or due to different properties of genes in particular functional classes for instance sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the x,y,z or w
selection can operate at the gene level at the expense of organismal fitness resulting in a selective advantage for selfish genetic elements in spite of a host cost examples of such selfish elements include transposable elements meiotic drivers killer x chromosomes selfish mitochondria and self-propagating introns (see intragenomic conflict.)
== genome architecture ==
=== genome size ===
genome size is influenced by the amount of repetitive dna as well as number of genes in an organism the c-value paradox refers to the lack of correlation between organism 'complexity' and genome size explanations for the so-called paradox are two-fold first repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms thereby inflating dna content of the haploid genome secondly the number of genes is not necessarily indicative of the number of developmental stages or tissue types in an organism an organism with few developmental stages or tissue types may have large numbers of genes that influence non-developmental phenotypes inflating gene content relative to developmental gene families
neutral explanations for genome size suggest that when population sizes are small many mutations become nearly neutral hence in small populations repetitive content and other 'junk' dna can accumulate without placing the organism at a competitive disadvantage there is little evidence to suggest that genome size is under strong widespread selection in multicellular eukaryotes genome size independent of gene content correlates poorly with most physiological traits and many eukaryotes including mammals harbor very large amounts of repetitive dna
however birds likely have experienced strong selection for reduced genome size in response to changing energetic needs for flight birds unlike humans produce nucleated red blood cells and larger nuclei lead to lower levels of oxygen transport bird metabolism is far higher than that of mammals due largely to flight and oxygen needs are high hence most birds have small compact genomes with few repetitive elements indirect evidence suggests that non-avian theropod dinosaur ancestors of modern birds also had reduced genome sizes consistent with endothermy and high energetic needs for running speed many bacteria have also experienced selection for small genome size as time of replication and energy consumption are so tightly correlated with fitness
=== repetitive elements ===
transposable elements are self-replicating selfish genetic elements which are capable of proliferating within host genomes many transposable elements are related to viruses and share several proteins in common
dna transposons are cut and paste transposable elements which excise dna and move it to alternate sections of the genome
non-ltr retrotransposons
ltr retrotransposons
helitrons
alu elements comprise over xx % of the human genome they are short non-autonomous repeat sequences
=== chromosome number and organization ===
the number of chromosomes in an organism's genome also does not necessarily correlate with the amount of dna in its genome the ant myrmecia pilosula has only a single pair of chromosomes whereas the adders-tongue fern ophioglossum reticulatum has up to 1260 chromosomes cilliate genomes house each gene in individual chromosomes resulting in a genome which is not physically linked reduced linkage through creation of additional chromosomes should effectively increase the efficiency of selection
changes in chromosome number can play a key role in speciation as differing chromosome numbers can serve as a barrier to reproduction in hybrids human chromosome 2 was created from a fusion of two chimpanzee chromosomes and still contains central telomeres as well as a vestigial second centromere polyploidy especially allopolyploidy which occurs often in plants can also result in reproductive incompatibilities with parental species agrodiatus blue butterflies have diverse chromosome numbers ranging from n=10 to n=134 and additionally have one of the highest rates of speciation identified to date
=== gene content and distribution ===
different organisms house different numbers of genes within their genomes as well as different patterns in the distribution of genes throughout the genome some organisms such as most bacteria drosophila and arabidopsis have particularly compact genomes with little repetitive content or non-coding dna other organisms like mammals or maize have large amounts of repetitive dna long introns and substantial spacing between different genes the content and distribution of genes within the genome can influence the rate at which certain types of mutations occur and can influence the subsequent evolution of different species genes with longer introns are more likely to recombine due to increased physical distance over the coding sequence as such long introns may facilitate ectopic recombination and result in higher rates of new gene formation
=== organelles ===
in addition to the nuclear genome endosymbiont organelles contain their own genetic material typically as circular plasmids mitochondrial and chloroplast dna varies across taxa but membrane-bound proteins especially electron transport chain constituents are most often encoded in the organelle chloroplasts and mitochondria are maternally inherited in most species as the organelles must pass through the egg in a rare departure some species of mussels are known to inherit mitochondria from father to son
== origins of new genes ==
new genes arise from several different genetic mechanisms including gene duplication de novo origination retrotransposition chimeric gene formation recruitment of non-coding sequence and gene truncation
in gene duplication a gene sequence is copied to create redundancy duplicated gene sequences can then mutate to develop new functions or to specialize so that each new gene performs a subset of the original ancestral functions in addition to duplicating whole genes sometimes only a domain or part of a protein is duplicated so that the resulting gene is an elongated version of the parental gene
retrotransposition creates new genes by copying mrna to dna and inserting it into the genome retrogenes often insert into new genomic locations and often develop new expression patterns and functions
chimeric genes form when duplication deletion or incomplete retrotransposition combine portions of two different coding sequences to produce a novel gene sequence chimeras often cause regulatory changes and can shuffle protein domains to produce novel adaptive functions
novel genes can also arise from previously non-coding dna for instance levine and colleagues reported the origin of five new genes in the d melanogaster genome from noncoding dna similar de novo origin of genes has been also shown in other organisms such as yeast rice and humans de novo genes may evolve from transcripts that are already expressed at low levels mutation of a stop codon to a regular codon or a frameshift may cause an extended protein that includes a previously non-coding sequence
== molecular phylogenetics ==
molecular systematics is a product of the traditional field of systematics and molecular genetics it uses dna rna or protein sequences to resolve questions in systematics i.e about their correct scientific classification or taxonomy from the point of view of evolutionary biology
molecular systematics has been made possible by the availability of techniques for dna sequencing which allow the determination of the exact sequence of nucleotides or bases in either dna or rna at present it is still a long and expensive process to sequence the entire genome of an organism and this has been done for only a few species however it is quite feasible to determine the sequence of a defined area of a particular chromosome typical molecular systematic analyses require the sequencing of around 1000 base pairs
== the driving forces of evolution ==
depending on the relative importance assigned to the various forces of evolution three perspectives provide evolutionary explanations for molecular evolution
selectionist hypotheses argue that selection is the driving force of molecular evolution while acknowledging that many mutations are neutral selectionists attribute changes in the frequencies of neutral alleles to linkage disequilibrium with other loci that are under selection rather than to random genetic drift biases in codon usage are usually explained with reference to the ability of even weak selection to shape molecular evolution
neutralist hypotheses emphasize the importance of mutation purifying selection and random genetic drift the introduction of the neutral theory by kimura quickly followed by king and jukes' own findings led to a fierce debate about the relevance of neodarwinism at the molecular level the neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most mutations in dna are at locations not important to function or fitness these neutral changes drift towards fixation within a population positive changes will be very rare and so will not greatly contribute to dna polymorphisms deleterious mutations will also not contribute very much to dna diversity because they negatively affect fitness and so will not stay in the gene pool for long this theory provides a framework for the molecular clock the fate of neutral mutations are governed by genetic drift and contribute to both nucleotide polymorphism and fixed differences between species
in the strictest sense the neutral theory is not accurate subtle changes in dna very often have effects but sometimes these effects are too small for natural selection to act on even synonymous mutations are not necessarily neutral because there is not a uniform amount of each codon the nearly neutral theory expanded the neutralist perspective suggesting that several mutations are nearly neutral which means both random drift and natural selection is relevant to their dynamics the main difference between the the neutral theory and nearly neutral theory is that the latter focuses on weak selection not strictly neutral
mutationists hypotheses emphasize random drift and biases in mutation patterns sueoka was the first to propose a modern mutationist view he proposed that the variation in gc content was not the result of positive selection but a consequence of the gc mutational pressure
== protein evolution ==
protein evolution describes the changes over time in protein shape function and composition through quantitative analysis and experimentation scientists have strived to understand the rate and causes of protein evolution using the amino acid sequences of hemoglobin and cytochrome c from multiple species scientists were able to derive estimations of protein evolution rates what they found was that the rates were not the same among proteins each protein has its own rate and that rate is constant across phylogenies (i.e. hemoglobin does not evolve at the same rate as cytochrome c but hemoglobins from humans mice etc do have comparable rates of evolution.) not all regions within a protein mutate at the same rate; functionally important areas mutate more slowly and amino acid substitutions of among similar amino acids occurs more often than a dissimilar substitution overall the level of polymorphisms in proteins seems to be fairly constant several species (including humans fruit flies and mice) have similar levels of protein polymorphism
=== relation to nucleic acid evolution ===
protein evolution is inescapably tied to changes and selection of dna polymorphisms and mutations because protein sequences change in response to alterations in the dna sequence amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences do not mutate at the same rate due to the degenerate nature of dna bases can change without affecting the amino acid sequence for example there are six codons that code for leucine thus despite the difference in mutation rates it is essential to incorporate nucleic acid evolution into the discussion of protein evolution at the end of the 1960s two groups of scientistskimura (1968) and king and jukes (1969)-- independently proposed that a majority of the evolutionary changes observed in proteins were neutral since then the neutral theory has been expanded upon and debated
== discordance with morphological evolution ==
there are sometimes discordances between molecular and morphological evolution which are reflected in molecular and morphological systematic studies especially of bacteria archaea and eukaryotic microbes these discordances can be categorized as two types: (i) one morphology multiple lineages (e.g morphological convergence cryptic species) and (ii) one lineage multiple morphologies (e.g phenotypic plasticity multiple life-cycle stages) neutral evolution possibly could explain the incongruences in some cases
== journals and societies ==
the society for molecular biology and evolution publishes the journals "molecular biology and evolution" and "genome biology and evolution" and holds an annual international meeting other journals dedicated to molecular evolution include journal of molecular evolution and molecular phylogenetics and evolution research in molecular evolution is also published in journals of genetics molecular biology genomics systematics and evolutionary biology
