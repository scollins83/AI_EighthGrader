plesiosauroidea (/plisisr/; greek: plsios/ 'near' or 'close to' and sauros/ 'lizard') is an extinct clade of carnivorous plesiosaur marine reptiles they have the longest neck to body ratio of any reptile plesiosauroids are known from the jurassic and cretaceous periods after their discovery some plesiosauroids were said to have resembled "a snake threaded through the shell of a turtle" although they had no shell
plesiosauroidea appeared at the early jurassic period (late sinemurian stage) and thrived until the k-pg extinction at the end of the cretaceous period the oldest confirmed plesiosauroid is plesiosaurus itself as all younger taxa were recently found to be pliosauroids while they were mesozoic diapsid reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs they did not belong to the latter gastroliths are frequently found associated with plesiosaurs
== history of discovery ==
the first complete plesiosauroid skeletons were found in england by mary anning in the early 19th century and were amongst the first fossil vertebrates to be described by science plesiosauroid remains were found by the scottish geologist hugh miller in 1844 in the rocks of the great estuarine group (then known as 'series') of western scotland many others have been found some of them virtually complete and new discoveries are made frequently one of the finest specimens was found in 2002 on the coast of somerset (england) by someone fishing from the shore this specimen called the collard specimen after its finder was on display in taunton museum in 2007 another less complete skeleton was also found in 2002 in the cliffs at filey yorkshire england by an amateur palaeontologist the preserved skeleton is displayed at rotunda museum in scarborough
== description ==
plesiosauroids had a broad body and a short tail they retained their ancestral two pairs of limbs which evolved into large flippers
it has been determined by teeth records that several sea-dwelling reptiles including plesiosauroids had a warm-blooded metabolism similar to that of mammals they could generate endothermic heat to survive in colder habitats
== evolution ==
plesiosauroids evolved from earlier similar forms such as pistosaurs there are a number of families of plesiosauroids which retain the same general appearance and are distinguished by various specific details these include the plesiosauridae unspecialized types which are limited to the early jurassic period; cryptoclididae (e.g cryptoclidus) with a medium-long neck and somewhat stocky build; elasmosauridae with very long inflexible necks and tiny heads; and the cimoliasauridae a poorly known group of small cretaceous forms according to traditional classifications all plesiosauroids have a small head and long neck but in recent classifications one short-necked and large-headed cretaceous group the polycotylidae are included under the plesiosauroidea rather than under the traditional pliosauroidea size of different plesiosaurs varied significantly with an estimated length of trinacromerum being three meters and mauisaurus growing to twenty meters

== behavior ==
unlike their pliosauroid cousins plesiosauroids (with the exception of the polycotylidae) were probably slow swimmers it is likely that they cruised slowly below the surface of the water using their long flexible neck to move their head into position to snap up unwary fish or cephalopods their four-flippered swimming adaptation may have given them exceptional maneuverability so that they could swiftly rotate their bodies as an aid to catching prey
contrary to many reconstructions of plesiosauroids it would have been impossible for them to lift their head and long neck above the surface in the "swan-like" pose that is often shown {everhart 2005} even if they had been able to bend their necks upward to that degree (which they could not) gravity would have tipped their body forward and kept most of the heavy neck in the water
on 12 august 2011 researchers from the u.s described a fossil of a pregnant plesiosaur found on a kansas ranch in 1987 the plesiosauroid polycotylus latippinus has confirmed that these predatory marine reptiles gave birth to single large live offspring - contrary to other marine reptile reproduction which typically involves a large number of small babies before this study plesiosauroids had sometimes been portrayed crawling out of water to lay eggs in the manner of sea turtles but experts had long suspected that their anatomy was not compatible to movement on land the adult plesiosaur measures 4 m long and the baby is 1.5 m long
