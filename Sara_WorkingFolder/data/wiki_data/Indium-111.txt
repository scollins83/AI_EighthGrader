indium-111 is an isotope of indium with a radioactive half-life of 2.80 days making it useful as a radioactive tracer it is made for this use by the nordion(canada) inc unit of nordion inc as indium-111 chloride solution and shipped to several firms which sterilize the pure solution combine it with carrier compounds if needed and repackage it for medical and industrial uses
among the medical applications of indium-111 are specialized diagnostic uses:
- indium-111 labeled antibodies;
- indium-111 oxine is also useful for isotopic labeling of blood cell components specifically the labeling of platelets for indium-111 for thrombus detection and indium-111 labelled leukocytes for localization of inflammation and abscesses and determination of leukocyte kinetics;
- labeling of peptides and other proteins with indium-111 to determine their uptake by rare cancers (for example the indium-111 octreotide scan is a highly specific and powerful tool for diagnosing carcinoid tumors paragangliomas some ectopic pheochromocytomas and other uncommon neuroendocrine tumors)
indium-111 decays by electron capture to cadmium-111 emitting a 0.1713 and 0.2454 mev gamma rays with a 2.8047 day radioactive half-life the parent isotope of indium-111 is tin-111 with a decay mode of electron capture indium-111 also undergoes isomeric transition emitting a 0.537 mev gamma ray with a 7.7 minute half-life
