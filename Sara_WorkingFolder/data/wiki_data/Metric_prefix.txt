a metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or fraction of the unit while all metric prefixes in common use today are decadic historically there have been a number of binary metric prefixes as well each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol the prefix kilo- for example may be added to gram to indicate multiplication by one thousand; one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams the prefix milli- likewise may be added to metre to indicate division by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre
decimal multiplicative prefixes have been a feature of all forms of the metric system with six dating back to the system's introduction in the 1790s metric prefixes have even been pre-pended to non-metric units the si prefixes are standardized for use in the international system of units (si) by the international bureau of weights and measures (bipm) in resolutions dating from 1960 to 1991 since 2009 they have formed part of the international system of quantities
== list of si prefixes ==
the bipm specifies twenty prefixes for the international system of units (si)
^ the metric system was introduced in 1795 with several metric prefixes of which however only six were adopted as si prefixes by the 11th cgpm conference in 1960 whereas myria (104) as well as double and demi were not adopted in 1873 micro and mega were recommended by the british association for the advancement of science the other dates relate to recognition by a resolution of the cgpm
each prefix name has a symbol which is used in combination with the symbols for units of measure for example the symbol for kilo- is k and is used to produce km kg and kw which are kilometre kilogram and kilowatt respectively
prefixes may not be used in combination this also applies to mass for which the si base unit (kilogram) already contains a prefix for example milligram (mg) is used instead of microkilogram (kg)
in arithmetic of measurements having prefixed units the prefixes must be expanded to their numeric multiplier except when adding or subtracting values with identical units hence 69975000000000000005 mv 69975000000000000005 ma = 69975000000000000005103 v 69975000000000000005103 a = 699524999999999999925106 w = 699524999999999999925 w
prefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred hence 100 m is preferred over 1 hm (hectometre) or 10 dam (decametres) the prefixes hecto deca deci and centi were commonly used for everyday purposes especially the centimetre (cm) is common however some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre because "use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion"
when units occur in exponentiation for example in square and cubic forms the multiplication prefix must be considered part of the unit and thus included in the exponentiation
1 km2 means one square kilometre or the area of a square of 70031000000000000001000 m by 70031000000000000001000 m and not 70031000000000000001000 square metres
2 mm3 means two cubic megametres or the volume of two cubes of 70061000000000000001000000 m by 70061000000000000001000000 m by 70061000000000000001000000 m or 701820000000000000021018 m3 and not 70062000000000000002000000 cubic metres (70062000000000000002106 m3)
examples
69985000000000000005 cm = 69985000000000000005102 m = 5 0.01 m = 0.05 m
70069000000000000009 km2 = 9 (103 m)2 = 9 (103)2 m2 = 70069000000000000009106 m2 = 9 70061000000000000001000000 m2 = 70069000000000000009000000 m2
3 mw = 70063000000000000003106 w = 3 70061000000000000001000000 w = 70063000000000000003000000 w
== application to units of measurement ==
the use of prefixes can be traced back to the introduction of the metric system in the 1790s long before the 1960 introduction of the si the prefixes including those introduced after 1960 are used with any metric unit whether officially included in the si or not (e.g millidynes and milligauss) metric prefixes may also be used with non-metric units
the choice of prefixes with a given unit is usually dictated by convenience of use unit prefixes for amounts that are much larger or smaller than those actually encountered are seldom used though they remain valid combinations in most contexts only a few most common combinations are established as standard
=== metric units ===
==== mass ====
in use the kilogram gram milligram microgram and smaller are fairly common however megagram (and gigagram teragram etc.) are rarely used; tonnes (and kilotonnes megatonnes etc.) or scientific notation are used instead megagram is occasionally used to disambiguate the metric tonne from the various non-metric tons an exception is pollution emission rates which are typically on the order of tg/yr sometimes only one element is denoted for an emission such as tg c/yr or tg n/yr so that inter-comparisons of different compounds are easier
uniquely among si units the base unit of mass the kilogram already includes a prefix the prefixes do not therefore indicate corresponding multiples of the base unit in the case of mass; for example a megagram is 70031000000000000001103 kg whereas mega- indicates a multiple of 7006100000000000000106
==== volume ====
the litre (equal to a cubic decimetre) millilitre (equal to a cubic centimetre) microlitre and smaller are common in europe the centilitre is often used for packaged products (such as wine) and the decilitre less frequently (the latter two items include prefixes corresponding to an exponent that is not divisible by three.)
larger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres megalitres or gigalitres or else in cubic metres (1 cubic metre = 1 kilolitre) or cubic kilometres (1 cubic kilometre = 1 teralitre) for scientific purposes the cubic metre is usually used
==== length ====
the kilometre metre centimetre millimetre and smaller are common (however the decimetre is rarely used.) the micrometre is often referred to by the non-si term micron in some fields such as chemistry the angstrom (equal to 0.1 nm) historically competed with the nanometre the femtometre used mainly in particle physics is usually called a fermi for large scales megametre gigametre and larger are rarely used instead non-metric units are used such as astronomical units light years and parsecs; the astronomical unit is mentioned in the si standards as an accepted non-si unit
==== time and angles ====
the second millisecond microsecond and shorter are common the kilosecond and megasecond also have some use though for these and longer times one usually uses either scientific notation or minutes hours and so on
official policies about the use of these prefixes vary slightly between the bureau international des poids et mesures (bipm) and the american national institute of standards and technology (nist); and some of the policies of both bodies are at variance with everyday practice for instance the nist advises that "to avoid confusion prefix symbols (and prefixes) are not used with the time-related unit symbols (names) min (minute) h (hour) d (day); nor with the angle-related symbols (names) (degree) (minute) and (second)."
the bipms position on the use of si prefixes with units of time larger than the second is the same as that of the nist but their position with regard to angles differs: they state "however astronomers use milliarcsecond which they denote mas and microarcsecond as which they use as units for measuring very small angles." the si unit of angle is the radian but as mentioned above degrees minutes and seconds see some scientific use
==== temperature ====
official policy also varies from common practice for the degree celsius (c) nist states:[2] "prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol c and prefixes may be used with the unit name 'degree celsius' for example 12 mc (12 millidegrees celsius) is acceptable." in practice it is more common for prefixes to be used with the kelvin when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences thus temperatures of star interiors may be given in units of mk (megakelvins) and molecular cooling may be described in mk (millikelvins)
==== energy ====
there exist a number of definitions for the non-si unit the calorie there are gram calories and kilogram calories one kilogram calorie which equals one thousand gram calories often appears capitalized and without a prefix (i.e 'cal') when referring to "dietary calories" in food it is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie but not to the kilogram calorie: thus for example 1 kcal = 1000 cal = 1 cal
=== non-metric units ===
metric prefixes are widely used outside the system of metric units common examples include the megabyte and the decibel metric prefixes rarely appear with imperial or us units except in some special cases (e.g. microinch kilofoot kilopound or 'kip') they are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields (e.g. megaelectronvolt gigaparsec millibarn) they are also occasionally used with currency units (e.g. gigadollar) mainly by people who are familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage

=== pronunciation ===
the prefix giga is usually pronounced // but sometimes /d/ according to the american writer kevin self in the 1920s a german committee member of the international electrotechnical commission proposed giga as a prefix for 109 drawing on a verse by the humorous poet christian morgenstern that appeared in the third (1908) edition of galgenlieder (gallows songs) this suggests a hard german g was originally intended as the pronunciation self was unable to ascertain when the /d/ (soft g) pronunciation was accepted but as of 1995 current practice had returned to // (hard g)
when an si prefix is affixed to a root word the prefix carries the stress while the root drops its stress but retains a full vowel in the syllable that is stressed when the root word stands alone for example gigabyte is /bat/ with stress on the first syllable however words in common use outside the scientific community may follow idiosyncratic stress rules in english speaking countries kilometre is often pronounced /klmtr/ with reduced vowels on both syllables of metre
=== typesetting ===
the latex typesetting system features an siunitx package in which the units of measurement are spelled out for example \si{3}{\tera\hertz} formats as "3 thz"
== non-standard prefixes ==
=== obsolete metric prefixes ===
some of the prefixes formerly used in the metric system have fallen into disuse and were not adopted into the si the decimal prefix myria- (sometimes also written as myrio-) (ten thousand) as well as the binary prefixes double- and demi- denoting a factor of 2 and 12 (one half) respectively were parts of the original metric system adopted by france in 1795 these were not retained when the si prefixes were internationally adopted by the 11th cgpm conference in 1960 the halving and doubling prefixes were dropped because they were neither decimal nor symmetrical
=== double prefixes ===
double prefixes have been used in the past such as micromillimetres or "millimicrons" (now nanometres) micromicrofarads (now picofarads) kilomegatons (now gigatons) hectokilometres (now 100 kilometres) and the derived adjective hectokilometric (typically used for qualifying the fuel consumption measures) these were disallowed with the introduction of the si
other obsolete double prefixes included "decimilli-" (104) which was contracted to "dimi-" and standardized in france up to 1961
=== "hella" prefix proposal ===
in 2010 uc davis student austin sendek started a petition to designate "hella" as the si prefix for one octillion (1027) the petition gathered over 60,000 supporters by circulating through facebook and receiving a significant amount of media coverage although the consultative committee for units considered the proposal it was ultimately rejected however hella has been adopted by certain websites such as google calculator and wolfram alpha
=== x w and v ===
brian c lacki follows z and y with the adopted prefixes x w and v to mean 70271000000000000001027 70301000000000000001030 and 70330999999999999991033 respectively thus continuing the inverse alphabetical order
== similar symbols and abbreviations ==
in written english the symbol k is often used informally to mean a multiple of thousand in many contexts for example one may talk of a 40k salary (40000) or call the year 2000 problem the y2k problem in these cases an uppercase k is often used this informal postfix is read or spoken as "thousand" or "grand" or just "k" but never "kilo" (despite that being the origin of the letter)
the financial and general news media mostly use m/m b/b and t/t as abbreviations for million billion (109) and trillion (1012) for large quantities typically currency and population
the medical and automotive fields in the united states use the abbreviations "cc" or "ccm" for cubic centimetres 1 cubic centimetre is equivalent to 1 millilitre most nations use millilitres in preference to cubic centimetres
for nearly a century the electrical construction industry used the abbreviation "mcm" to designate a "thousand circular mils" in specifying thicknesses of large electrical cables since the mid-1990s "kcmil" has been adopted as the "official" designation of a thousand circular mils but the designation "mcm" still remains in wide use a similar system is used in natural gas sales in the united states: m (or m) for thousands and mm (or mm) for millions of british thermal units or therms and in the oil industry where 'mmbbl' is the symbol for 'millions of barrels'
=== binary prefixes ===
in some fields of information technology it has been common to designate non-decimal multiples based on powers of 1024 rather than 1000 for some si prefixes (kilo mega giga) contrary to the definitions in the international system of units (si) this practice has been sanctioned by some industry associations including jedec the international electrotechnical commission (iec) standardized the system of binary prefixes (kibi mebi gibi etc.) for this purpose
