in organic molecules functional groups are atom or atoms which are responsible for the characteristic properties of that molecule with the exceptions of double and triple bonds which are also functional groups
some common functional groups are -cooh (carboxylic acids) -cho (aldehyde) -conh2 (amide) -cn (nitrile) -oh (alcohol) etc
when two of such different functional groups are present in a single organic molecule then it is called bifunctional molecule which has properties of two different types of functional groups many of bifunctional molecules are used to produce medicine catalysts and also used in condensation polymerization like polyester polyamide etc
