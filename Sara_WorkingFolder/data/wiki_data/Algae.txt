algae (/ldi/ or /li/; singular alga /l/) is an informal term for a large diverse group of eukaryotes that are not necessarily closely related and are thus polyphyletic included organisms range from unicellular genera such as chlorella and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp a large brown alga that may grow up to 50 meters in length most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types such as stomata xylem and phloem that are found in land plants the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the charophyta a division of green algae that includes for example spirogyra and the stoneworts
there is no generally accepted definition of algae one definition is that algae "have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells" some authors exclude all prokaryotes and thus do not consider cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) as algae
algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have a single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga
algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction
algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs that are found in tracheophytes (vascular plants) most are phototrophic although some groups contain members that are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs (also called colorless or apochlorotic algae) sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus some other heterotrophic organisms like the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago
== etymology and study ==
the singular alga is the latin word for "seaweed" and retains that meaning in english the etymology is obscure although some speculate that it is related to latin algre "be cold" there is no known reason to associate seaweed with temperature a more likely source is alliga "binding entwining."
the ancient greek word for seaweed was (fkos or phykos) which could mean either the seaweed (probably red algae) or a red dye derived from it the latinization fcus meant primarily the cosmetic rouge the etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical (pk) "paint" (if not that word itself) a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean it could be any color: black red green blue
accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology depending on whether the greek or latin root is used the name fucus appears in a number of taxa
== classification ==
most algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and presumably represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria however the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely
phylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy:
linnaeus in species plantarum (1753) the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature recognized 14 genera of algae of which only 4 are currently considered among algae in systema naturae linnaeus described the genera volvox and corallina among the animals
in 1768 samuel gottlieb gmelin (17441774) published the historia fucorum the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves
w.h.harvey (18111866) and lamouroux (1813) were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics harvey's four divisions are: red algae (rhodospermae) brown algae (melanospermae) green algae (chlorospermae) and diatomaceae
at this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers (e.g. o f mller and ehrenberg) studying the infusoria (microscopic organisms) unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile even the non-motile (coccoid) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the life cycle of plants macroalgae or animals
although used as a taxonomic category in some pre-darwinian classifications e.g. linnaeus (1753) de jussieu (1789) horaninow (1843) agassiz (1859) wilson & cassin (1864) in further classifications the "algae" are seen as an artificial polyphyletic group
throughout the 20th century most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae: cyanophytes rhodophytes chrysophytes xanthophytes bacillariophytes phaeophytes pyrrhophytes (cryptophytes and dinophytes) euglenophytes and chlorophytes later many new groups were discovered (e.g. bolidophyceae) and others were splintered from older groups: charophytes and glaucophytes (from chlorophytes) many heterokontophytes (e.g. synurophytes from chrysophytes or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes) haptophytes (from chrysophytes) and chlorarachniophytes (from xanthophytes)
with the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous classification most groups of algae (sometimes all) were included in protista later also abandoned in favour of eukaryota however as a legacy of the older plant life scheme some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications (see ambiregnal protists)
some parasitic algae (e.g. the green algae prototheca and helicosporidium parasites of metazoans or cephaleuros parasites of plants) were originally classified as fungi sporozoans or protistans of incertae sedis while others (e.g. the green algae phyllosiphon and rhodochytrium parasites of plants or the red algae pterocladiophila and gelidiocolax mammillatus parasites of other red algae or the dinoflagellates oodinium parasites of fish) had their relationship with algae conjectured early in other cases some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g. chlorochytrium) but later were seen as endophytic algae furthermore groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae
== relationship to land plants ==
the first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like chara almost 500 million years ago these probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago
== morphology ==
a range of algal morphologies are exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common the only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups: the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes the form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode 'stems'; whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait; they appear in the coralline algae and the hildenbrandiales as well as the browns
most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the life cycle of a species are
colonial: small regular groups of motile cells
capsoid: individual non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
coccoid: individual non-motile cells with cell walls
palmelloid: non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
filamentous: a string of non-motile cells connected together sometimes branching
parenchymatous: cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissues
in three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation these are the brown algae,some of which may reach 50 m in length (kelps)the red algae and the green algae the most complex forms are found among the green algae (see charales and charophyta) in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants the point where these non-algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers a characteristic not found in the other alga groups
== physiology ==
many algae particularly members of the characeae have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentials
phytohormones are found not only in higher plants but in algae too
== symbiotic algae ==
some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae examples are as follows
=== lichens ===
lichens are defined by the international association for lichenology to be "an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure." the fungi or mycobionts are mainly from the ascomycota with a few from the basidiomycota they are not found alone in nature; but when they began to associate is not known one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria (hence "photobiont" is the more accurate term) a photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently; accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species the association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated) it is possible that the photobiont triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont
=== coral reefs ===
coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order scleractinia (stony corals) these animals metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell-building processes including secretion of the exoskeleton with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts dinoflagellates (algal protists) are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coral-forming marine invertebrates where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host reef-building stony corals (hermatypic corals) require endosymbiotic algae from the genus symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition the loss of symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef
=== sea sponges ===
green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponge (halichondria panicea) the alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species
== life-cycle ==
rhodophyta chlorophyta and heterokontophyta the three main algal divisions have life-cycles which show considerable variation and complexity in general there is an asexual phase where the seaweed's cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible commonly in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae two specialized sexually compatible haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote to ensure a successful mating the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated; pheromones may play a key role in these processes sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of dna damages during meiosis a key stage of the sexual cycle however sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae
== numbers ==
the algal collection of the us national herbarium (located in the national museum of natural history) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens which although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists) gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown) estimates vary widely for example according to one standard textbook in the british isles the uk biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be 20000 algal species in the uk another checklist reports only about 5000 species regarding the difference of about 15000 species the text concludes: "it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species "
regional and group estimates have been made as well:
50005500 species of red algae worldwide
"some 1300 in australian seas"
400 seaweed species for the western coastline of south africa and 212 species from the coast of kwazulu-natal some of these are duplicates as the range extends across both coasts and the total recorded is probably about 500 species most of these are listed in list of seaweeds of south africa these exclude phytoplankton and crustose corallines
669 marine species from california (us)
642 in the check-list of britain and ireland
and so on but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources these numbers have no more credibility than the british ones mentioned above most estimates also omit microscopic algae such as phytoplankton
the most recent estimate suggests 72,500 algal species worldwide
== distribution ==
the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid-19th century ad algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores spores are everywhere in all parts of the earth: the waters fresh and marine the atmosphere free-floating and in precipitation or mixed with dust the humus and in other organisms such as humans whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions of where the spore lands
the spores of fresh-water algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers the bodies of water into which they are transported are chemically selective marine spores are spread by currents ocean water is temperature selective resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces
to some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as "pacific algae" or "north sea algae" when they occur out of their localities it is usually possible to hypothesize a transport mechanism such as the hulls of ships for example ulva reticulata and ulva fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner
mapping is possible for select species only: "there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns." for example clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there on the other hand scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the "difficulties of undertaking such studies."
== ecology ==
algae are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow and on ice seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under 100 metres (330 ft); however some have been recorded to a depth of 360 metres (1,180 ft)
the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column (phytoplankton) provide the food base for most marine food chains in very high densities (algal blooms) these algae may discolor the water and outcompete poison or asphyxiate other life forms
algae are variously sensitive to different factors which has made them useful as biological indicators in the ballantine scale and its modification
on the basis of their habitat algae can be categorized as: aquatic (planktonic benthic marine freshwater) terrestrial aerial (subareial) lithophytic halophytic (or euryhaline) psammon thermophilic cryophilic epibiont (epiphytic epizoic) endosymbiont (endophytic endozoic) parasitic calcifilic or lichenic (phycobiont)
== cultural associations ==
in classical chinese the word is used both for "algae" and (in the modest tradition of the imperial scholars) for "literary talent" the third island in kunming lake beside the summer palace in beijing is known as the zaojian tang dao which thus simultaneously means "island of the algae-viewing hall" and "island of the hall for reflecting on literary talent"
== uses ==
=== agar ===
agar a gelatinous substance derived from red algae has a number of commercial uses it is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi as most microorganisms cannot digest agar
=== alginates ===
alginic acid or alginate is extracted from brown algae its uses range from gelling agents in food to medical dressings alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours
between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of macrocystis are harvested annually in new mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed
=== energy source ===
to be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from (local) policy on the long run biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels here algae based fuels hold great promise directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass the break-even point for algae-based biofuels is estimated to occur by 2025
=== fertilizer ===
for centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; george owen of henllys writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in south wales:
this kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes where it heteth and rotteth and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land as they do their muck and thereof springeth good corn especially barley  after spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea they fetch it in sacks on horse backes and carie the same three four or five miles and cast it on the lande which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass
today algae are used by humans in many ways; for example as fertilizers soil conditioners and livestock feed aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner
=== nutrition ===
naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food especially in asia they provide many vitamins including: a b1 b2 b6 niacin and c and are rich in iodine potassium iron magnesium and calcium in addition commercially cultivated microalgae including both algae and cyanobacteria are marketed as nutritional supplements such as spirulina chlorella and the vitamin-c supplement dunaliella high in beta-carotene
algae are national foods of many nations: china consumes more than 70 species including fat choy a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable; japan over 20 species; ireland dulse; chile cochayuyo laver is used to make "laver bread" in wales where it is known as bara lawr; in korea gim; in japan nori and aonori it is also used along the west coast of north america from california to british columbia in hawaii and by the mori of new zealand sea lettuce and badderlocks are a salad ingredient in scotland ireland greenland and iceland
the oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids for example parietochloris incisa is very high in arachidonic acid where it reaches up to 47% of the triglyceride pool some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long-chain essential omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) fish oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids but the original source is algae (microalgae in particular) which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain algae have emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega-3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get long-chain epa and dha from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil which only contains the short-chain alpha-linolenic acid (ala)
=== pollution control ===
sewage can be treated with algae reducing the usage of large amounts of toxic chemicals that would otherwise be needed
algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms when subsequently harvested the enriched algae itself can be used as fertilizer
aquariums and ponds can be filtered using algae which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber also known as an algae turf scrubber (a t s) 
agricultural research service scientists found that 6090% of nitrogen runoff and 70100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber also called an algal turf scrubber (ats) scientists developed the ats which consists of shallow 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ats and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ats organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers algae scrubbers using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions are now also being used to filter aquariums and ponds
=== bioremediation ===
the alga stichococcus bacillaris has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites; biodegrading the synthetic substance
=== pigments ===
the natural pigments (carotenoids and chlorophylls) produced by algae can be used as an alternative to chemical dyes and coloring agents the presence of some individual alga pigments together with specific pigment concentrations ratios are taxon-specific: analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods particularly high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural alga populations in sea water samples
=== stabilizing substances ===
carrageenan from the red alga chondrus crispus is used as a stabilizer in milk products
