the gymnosperms are a group of seed-producing plants that includes conifers cycads ginkgo and gnetales the term "gymnosperm" comes from the greek composite word ( gymnos "naked" and sperma "seed") meaning "naked seeds" after the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state) their naked condition stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms) which are enclosed within an ovary gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves often modified to form cones or at the end of short stalks as in ginkgo
the gymnosperms and angiosperms together compose the spermatophytes or seed plants by far the largest group of living gymnosperms are the conifers (pines cypresses and relatives) followed by cycads gnetophytes (gnetum ephedra and welwitschia) and ginkgo (a single living species)
== classification ==
in early classification schemes the gymnosperms (gymnospermae) were regarded as a "natural" group there is conflicting evidence on the question of whether the living gymnosperms form a clade the fossil record of gymnosperms includes many distinctive taxa that do not belong to the four modern groups including seed-bearing trees that have a somewhat fern-like vegetative morphology (the so-called "seed ferns" or pteridosperms.) when fossil gymnosperms such as bennettitales caytonia and the glossopterids are considered it is clear that angiosperms are nested within a larger gymnosperm clade although which group of gymnosperms is their closest relative remains unclear

== diversity and origin ==
there are more than 1000 extant or currently living species of gymnosperms in 88 plant genera belonging to 14 plant families
it is widely accepted that the gymnosperms originated in the late carboniferous period replacing the lycopsid rainforests of the tropical region this appears to have been the result of a whole genome duplication event around 319 million years ago early characteristics of seed plants were evident in fossil progymnosperms of the late devonian period around 380 million years ago it has been suggested that during the mid-mesozoic era pollination of some extinct groups of gymnosperms was by extinct species of scorpionflies that had specialized proboscis for feeding on pollination drops the scorpionflies likely engaged in pollination mutualisms with gymnosperms long before the similar and independent coevolution of nectar-feeding insects on angiosperms
conifers are by far the most abundant extant group of gymnosperms with six to eight families with a total of 65-70 genera and 600-630 species (696 accepted names) conifers are woody plants and most are evergreens the leaves of many conifers are long thin and needle-like other species including most cupressaceae and some podocarpaceae have flat triangular scale-like leaves agathis in araucariaceae and nageia in podocarpaceae have broad flat strap-shaped leaves
cycads are the next most abundant group of gymnosperms with two or three families 11 genera and approximately 300 species the other extant groups are the 75-80 species of gnetales and one species of ginkgo
== uses ==
gymnosperms have major economic uses pine fir spruce and cedar are all examples of conifers that are used for lumber some other common uses for gymnosperms are soap varnish nail polish food gum and perfumes
== life cycle ==
gymnosperms like all vascular plants have a sporophyte-dominant life cycle the gametophyte (gamete-bearing phase) is relatively short-lived two spore types microspores and megaspores are typically produced in pollen cones or ovulate cones respectively gametophytes as with all heterosporous plants develop within the spore wall pollen grains (microgametophytes) mature from microspores and ultimately produce sperm cells megagametophytes develop from megaspores and are retained within the ovule they typically produce multiple archegonia during pollination pollen grains are physically transferred between plants from pollen cone to the ovule being transferred by wind or insects whole grains enter each ovule through a microscopic gap in the ovule coat (integument) called the micropyle the pollen grains mature further inside the ovule and produce sperm cells two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms cycads and ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm with no flagella that are conveyed to the egg along a pollen tube after syngamy (joining of the sperm and egg cell) the zygote develops into an embryo (young sporophyte) more than one embryo is usually initiated in each gymnosperm seed the mature seed comprises the embryo and the remains of the female gametophyte which serves as a food supply and the seed coat (integument)
== genetics ==
the first published sequenced genome for any gymnosperm was the genome of picea abies in 2013
