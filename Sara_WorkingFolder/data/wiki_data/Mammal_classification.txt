mammalia is a class of animal within the phylum chordata mammal classification has been through several iterations since carolus linnaeus initially defined the class many earlier ideas have been completely abandoned by linnaeus and modern taxonomists among these are the idea that bats are related to birds or that humans represent a group outside of other living things competing ideas about the relationships of mammal orders do persist and are currently in development most significantly in recent years cladistic thinking has led to an effort to ensure that all taxonomic designations represent monophyletic groups the field has also seen a recent surge in interest and modification due to the results of molecular phylogenetics
george gaylord simpson's classic "principles of classification and a classification of mammals" (simpson 1945) was the original source for the taxonomy listed here simpson laid out a systematics of mammal origins and relationships that was universally taught until the end of the 20th century
since simpson's 1945 classification the paleontological record has been recalibrated and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself partly through the new concept of cladistics though field work gradually made simpson's classification outdated it remained the closest thing to an official classification of mammals see list of placental mammals and list of monotremes and marsupials for more detailed information on mammal genera and species
== molecular classification of placentals ==
molecular studies by molecular systematists based on dna analysis in the early 21st century have revealed new relationships among mammal families classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals- afrotheria xenarthra and boreotheria- which diverged from early common ancestors in the cretaceous
the relationships between these three lineages is contentious and all three have been proposed as basal in different hypotheses
the first divergence was that of the afrotheria 110100 million years ago (mya) the afrotheria proceeded to evolve and diversify in the isolation of the african-arabian continent the xenarthra isolated in south america diverged from the boreoeutheria approximately 10095 mya the boreoeutheria split into the laurasiatheria and euarchontoglires between 95 and 85 mya; both of these groups evolved on the northern continent of laurasia
after tens of millions of years of relative isolation africa-arabia collided with eurasia and the formation of the isthmus of panama linked south america and north america facilitating the distribution of mammals seen today with the exception of bats and murine rodents no placental land mammals reached australasia until the first human settlers arrived approximately 50,000 years ago
it should however be noted that these molecular results are still controversial mainly because they are not reflected by morphological data and thus not accepted by many systematists it is also important to note that fossil taxa are not and in most cases cannot be included although there are instances of dna being recovered from prehistoric mammals such as the ground sloth mylodon and neanderthal humans homo neanderthalensis fossils can generally only be incorporated in morphological analyses

== standardized textbook classification ==
a somewhat standardized classification system has been adopted by most current mammalogy classroom textbooks the following taxonomy of extant and recently extinct mammals is taken from vaughan et al (2000) this approach emphasizes an initial split between egg-laying prototherians and live-bearing therians the therians are further divided into the marsupial metatheria and the "placental" eutheria no attempt is made here to further distinguish among the orders within these subclasses and infraclasses this system also makes no note of the position of entirely fossil groups

== mckenna/bell classification ==
in 1997 the mammals were comprehensively revised by malcolm c mckenna and susan k bell which has resulted in the "mckenna/bell classification"
mckenna and bell classification of mammals: above the species level (mckenna & bell 1997) is the most comprehensive work to date on the systematics relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa living and extinct down through the rank of genus the new mckenna/bell classification was quickly accepted by paleontologists the authors worked together as paleontologists at the american museum of natural history new york mckenna inherited the project from simpson and with bell constructed a completely updated hierarchical system covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of mammalia
the mckenna/bell hierarchical listing of all of the terms used for mammal groups above the species includes extinct mammals as well as modern groups and introduces some fine distinctions such as legions and sublegions and (ranks which fall between classes and orders) that are likely to be glossed over by the layman
the published re-classification forms both a comprehensive and authoritative record of approved names and classifications and a list of invalid names

== luo kielan-jaworowska and cifelli classification ==
several important fossil mammal discoveries have been made that have led researchers to question many of the relationships proposed by mckenna and bell (1997) additionally researchers are subjecting taxonomic hypotheses to more rigorous cladistic analyses of early mammal fossils luo et al (2002) summarized existing ideas and proposed new ideas of relationships among mammals at the most basal level they argued that the term mammal should be defined based on characters (especially the dentary-squamosal jaw articulation) instead of a crown-based definition (the group that contains most recent common ancestor of monotremes and therians and all of its descendants) their definition of mammalia is roughly equal to the mammaliaformes as defined by mckenna and bell (1997) and other authors they also define their taxonomic levels as clades and do not apply linnean hierarchies
mammalia
sinoconodon - earliest and most basal of mammals
unnamed clade 1 - a clade that contains all other mammals these are characterized by determinant growth and occlusal features of the cheek teeth
morganucodontidae - morganucodontids including morganucodon megazostrodon and others
docodonta - docodonts including haldanodon and castorocauda (ji et al. 2006)
unnamed clade 2 - a clade containing all living mammals and some fossil relatives it is characterized by the loss of a postdentary trough and a widened braincase
hadrocodium
kuehneotherium
crown-group mammalia - the group that contains most recent common ancestor of monotremes and therians and all of its descendants this group is defined by additional characters relating the occlusion of molars and the presence of a well-developed masseteric fossa
australosphenida - a clade that contains monotremes and their fossil relatives these fossils include ambondro asfaltomylos ausktribosphenos and bishops if correct this clade represents an independent evolution of the tribosphenic molar in southern continents
trechnotheria - therians spalacotheriids and their relatives they are characterized by features of the scapula tibia and humerus
spalacotheriidae - including akidolestes zhangheotherium and maotherium
cladotheria - therians dryolestids and their relatives they are characterized by features of the tribosphenic molar and the angular process of the dentary
dryolestidae
amphitherium - incertae sedis (it may be a prototribosphenidan)
prototribosphenida - therians and fossil relatives including vincelestes characterized by features of the cochlea including coiling
vincelestes
zatheria - therians and fossil relatives including the "peramurids" characterized by the presence of wear in the talonid of the lower molars
"peramuridae" - peramus and relatives known only from preserved mandibles and distinctly zatherian molars
boreosphenida - therians and fossil relatives including kielantherium they are characterized by molar features
kielantherium
deltatheroida including deltatheridium - incertae sedis (it may represent a metatherian)
crown-group theria - the group that contains most recent common ancestor of marsupials and placentals and all of its descendants characterized by a host of molar features aspects of the alispenoid and aspects of the astragalus region
eutriconodonta - incertae sedis triconodonts appear to be a member of the crown-mammalia clade but their relationships within it are unknown it is also not certain that they represent a monophyletic group examples include repenomamus
multituberculata - incertae sedis luo e al (2002) argue that multituberculates cannot be confidently placed in a particular clade of mammals they suggest that they represent either basal mammals or are sister to the trechnotheria
== simplified classification for non-specialists ==
the following classification is a simplified version based on current understanding suitable for non-specialists who want to understand how living genera are related to each other the classification ignores differences in levels and thus cannot be used to estimate the respective distances between taxa it also ignores taxa that became extinct in pre-historic times finally english names are preferred whenever they exist this makes it especially suited for non-specialists who wish to gain an easy overview for the full picture the non-simplified versions above should be consulted
