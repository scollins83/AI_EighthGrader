cuphophyllus pratensis is a species of agaric (gilled mushroom) in the family hygrophoraceae it has been given the recommended english name of meadow waxcap in the uk and in north america has variously been called the meadow waxy cap salmon waxy cap and butter meadowcap the species has a widespread mainly temperate distribution occurring in grassland in europe and in woodland elsewhere the basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are edible and are occasionally collected and sold commercially
== taxonomy ==
the species was first described in 1774 by the german mycologist and naturalist jacob christian schffer as agaricus pratensis it was subsequently combined in a number of different genera before being transferred to hygrocybe in 1914 the specific epithet comes from latin "pratensis" (= growing in meadows) molecular research published in 2011 based on cladistic analysis of dna sequences found hygrocybe pratensis not to belong in hygrocybe sensu stricto and was moved back to the genus cuphophyllus in which it had previously been placed
== description ==
basidiocarps are agaricoid up to 150 mm (6 in) tall the cap convex at first becoming flat umbonate or slightly depressed when expanded up to 125 mm (5 in) across the cap surface is smooth and dry pale salmon to orange-buff the lamellae (gills) are waxy pale cap-coloured and decurrent (widely attached to and running down the stipe) the stipe (stem) is smooth cylindrical or tapering to the base and cream to pale cap-coloured the spore print is white the spores (under a microscope) smooth inamyloid ellipsoid about 5.5 to 6.5 by 4.0 to 5.0 m
=== similar species ===
hygrocybe berkeleyi is very similar but fruit bodies are white (it has sometimes been considered a variety of h pratensis) hygrophorus nemoreus is also similar but is an ectomycorrhizal species growing in woodland with oaks and has a distinctly mealy smell
== distribution and habitat ==
the meadow waxcap has a widespread distribution mainly occurring in temperate zones it has been recorded in europe north africa north and south america northern asia australia and new zealand like other waxcaps it grows in old unimproved short-sward grassland (pastures and lawns) in europe but in woodland elsewhere recent research suggests waxcaps are neither mycorrhizal nor saprotrophic but may be associated with mosses
== conservation ==
in europe cuphophyllus pratensis is typical of waxcap grasslands a declining habitat due to changing agricultural practices though the species is one of the commoner members of the genus it nonetheless appears on the official or provisional national red lists of threatened fungi in a few european countries including the czech republic germany (bavaria) and poland
== edibility ==
fruit bodies of the meadow waxcap are edible and in some countries are seasonally collected for commercial sale in local markets
