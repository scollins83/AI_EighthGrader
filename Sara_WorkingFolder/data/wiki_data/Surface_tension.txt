surface tension is the elastic tendency of liquids that makes them acquire the least surface area possible surface tension causes insects (e.g water striders) usually denser than water to float and stride on the water surface
at liquid-air interfaces surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion) the net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane thus the surface becomes under tension from the imbalanced forces which is probably where the term "surface tension" came from because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other water has a high surface tension (72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 c) compared to that of most other liquids surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity
surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length or of energy per unit area the two are equivalentbut when referring to energy per unit of area people use the term surface energywhich is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids and not just liquids
in materials science surface tension is used for either surface stress or surface free energy
== causes ==
the cohesive forces among liquid molecules are responsible for the phenomenon of surface tension in the bulk of the liquid each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules resulting in a net force of zero the molecules at the surface do not have the same molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards this creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area
surface tension is responsible for the shape of liquid droplets although easily deformed droplets of water tend to be pulled into a spherical shape by the imbalance in cohesive forces of the surface layer in the absence of other forces including gravity drops of virtually all liquids would be approximately spherical the spherical shape minimizes the necessary "wall tension" of the surface layer according to laplace's law
another way to view surface tension is in terms of energy a molecule in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor) the interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy for the liquid to minimize its energy state the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized the minimized quantity of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area as a result of surface area minimization a surface will assume the smoothest shape it can (mathematical proof that "smooth" shapes minimize surface area relies on use of the eulerlagrange equation) since any curvature in the surface shape results in greater area a higher energy will also result consequently the surface will push back against any curvature in much the same way as a ball pushed uphill will push back to minimize its gravitational potential energy
== effects of surface tension ==
=== water ===
several effects of surface tension can be seen with ordinary water:
a beading of rain water on a waxy surface such as a leaf water adheres weakly to wax and strongly to itself so water clusters into drops surface tension gives them their near-spherical shape because a sphere has the smallest possible surface area to volume ratio
b formation of drops occurs when a mass of liquid is stretched the animation shows water adhering to the faucet gaining mass until it is stretched to a point where the surface tension can no longer keep the drop linked to the faucet it then separates and surface tension forms the drop into a sphere if a stream of water was running from the faucet the stream would break up into drops during its fall gravity stretches the stream then surface tension pinches it into spheres
c flotation of objects denser than water occurs when the object is nonwettable and its weight is small enough to be borne by the forces arising from surface tension for example water striders use surface tension to walk on the surface of a pond the surface of the water behaves like an elastic film: the insect's feet cause indentations in the water's surface increasing its surface area
d separation of oil and water (in this case water and liquid wax) is caused by a tension in the surface between dissimilar liquids this type of surface tension is called "interface tension" but its chemistry is the same
e tears of wine is the formation of drops and rivulets on the side of a glass containing an alcoholic beverage its cause is a complex interaction between the differing surface tensions of water and ethanol; it is induced by a combination of surface tension modification of water by ethanol together with ethanol evaporating faster than water
=== surfactants ===
surface tension is visible in other common phenomena especially when surfactants are used to decrease it:
soap bubbles have very large surface areas with very little mass bubbles in pure water are unstable the addition of surfactants however can have a stabilizing effect on the bubbles (see marangoni effect) notice that surfactants actually reduce the surface tension of water by a factor of three or more
emulsions are a type of solution in which surface tension plays a role tiny fragments of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses but the presence of a surfactant provides a decrease in surface tension which permits stability of minute droplets of oil in the bulk of water (or vice versa)
== physics ==
=== physical units ===
surface tension usually represented by the symbol  is measured in force per unit length its si unit is newton per meter but the cgs unit of dyne per cm is also used
=== surface area growth ===
the effect of surface tension on the interface area between two liquids may be equivalently defined either through force or through energy in terms of force: surface tension of a liquid is one-half the force per unit length required to keep still a movable side of a frame over which the liquid is stretched (say into a thin film) to visualize this imagine a rectangular frame which is composed of three unmovable sides that form a "u" shape and the fourth movable side that can slide along the two parallel unmovable sides either towards or away from the unmovable "bottom" side of the "u." now imagine that a liquid is stretched into a thin film on this frame much like soap water gets stretched over a bubble-blowing ring after the ring is dunked into soapy water then it is observed that the movable side will be pulled by the film towards the "bottom" of the "u"; the force required to stop the movable side from sliding turns out to be proportional to the length of the movable side thus the ratio depends only on the intrinsic properties of the liquid (composition temperature etc.) but not on its geometry; for example if the frame has a more complicated shape the ratio  with the length of the movable side and the force required to stop it from sliding is found to be the same for all shapes we therefore define the surface tension as
the reason for the is that the film has two sides each of which contributes equally to the force; so the force contributed by each side is  which adds up to a total force of 
in terms of energy: surface tension of a liquid is the ratio of 1) the change in the energy of the liquid and 2) the change in the surface area of the liquid (that led to the change in energy) this can be easily related to the previous definition in terms of force: if is the force required to stop the side from starting to slide then this is also the force that would keep the side in the state of sliding at a constant speed (by newton's second law) but if the side is moving then the surface area of the stretched liquid is increasing while the applied force is doing work on the liquid this means that increasing the surface area increases the energy of the film the work done by the force in moving the side by distance is ; at the same time the total area of the film increases by (the factor of 2 is here because the liquid has two sides two surfaces) thus multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of by  we get
this work is by the usual arguments interpreted as being stored as potential energy consequently surface tension can be also measured in si system as joules per square meter and in the cgs system as ergs per cm2 since mechanical systems try to find a state of minimum potential energy a free droplet of liquid naturally assumes a spherical shape which has the minimum surface area for a given volume the equivalence of measurement of energy per unit area to force per unit length can be proven by dimensional analysis
=== surface curvature and pressure ===
if no force acts normal to a tensioned surface the surface must remain flat but if the pressure on one side of the surface differs from pressure on the other side the pressure difference times surface area results in a normal force in order for the surface tension forces to cancel the force due to pressure the surface must be curved the diagram shows how surface curvature of a tiny patch of surface leads to a net component of surface tension forces acting normal to the center of the patch when all the forces are balanced the resulting equation is known as the younglaplace equation:
where:
p is the pressure difference known as the laplace pressure
is surface tension
rx and ry are radii of curvature in each of the axes that are parallel to the surface
the quantity in parentheses on the right hand side is in fact (twice) the mean curvature of the surface (depending on normalisation) solutions to this equation determine the shape of water drops puddles menisci soap bubbles and all other shapes determined by surface tension (such as the shape of the impressions that a water strider's feet make on the surface of a pond) the table below shows how the internal pressure of a water droplet increases with decreasing radius for not very small drops the effect is subtle but the pressure difference becomes enormous when the drop sizes approach the molecular size (in the limit of a single molecule the concept becomes meaningless.)
=== floating objects ===
when an object is placed on a liquid its weight fw depresses the surface and is balanced by the surface tension forces on either side fs which are each parallel to the water's surface at the points where it contacts the object notice that the horizontal components of the two fs arrows point in opposite directions so they cancel each other but the vertical components point in the same direction and therefore add up to balance fw the object's surface must not be wettable for this to happen and its weight must be low enough for the surface tension to support it
=== liquid surface ===
to find the shape of the minimal surface bounded by some arbitrary shaped frame using strictly mathematical means can be a daunting task yet by fashioning the frame out of wire and dipping it in soap-solution a locally minimal surface will appear in the resulting soap-film within seconds
the reason for this is that the pressure difference across a fluid interface is proportional to the mean curvature as seen in the young-laplace equation for an open soap film the pressure difference is zero hence the mean curvature is zero and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature
=== contact angles ===
the surface of any liquid is an interface between that liquid and some other medium the top surface of a pond for example is an interface between the pond water and the air surface tension then is not a property of the liquid alone but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium if a liquid is in a container then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface there is also an interface between the liquid and the walls of the container the surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container and where the two surfaces meet their geometry must be such that all forces balance
where the two surfaces meet they form a contact angle  which is the angle the tangent to the surface makes with the solid surface the diagram to the right shows two examples tension forces are shown for the liquid-air interface the liquid-solid interface and the solid-air interface the example on the left is where the difference between the liquid-solid and solid-air surface tension  is less than the liquid-air surface tension  but is nevertheless positive that is
in the diagram both the vertical and horizontal forces must cancel exactly at the contact point known as equilibrium the horizontal component of is canceled by the adhesive force 
the more telling balance of forces though is in the vertical direction the vertical component of must exactly cancel the force 
since the forces are in direct proportion to their respective surface tensions we also have:
where
is the liquid-solid surface tension
is the liquid-air surface tension
is the solid-air surface tension
is the contact angle where a concave meniscus has contact angle less than 90 and a convex meniscus has contact angle of greater than 90
this means that although the difference between the liquid-solid and solid-air surface tension  is difficult to measure directly it can be inferred from the liquid-air surface tension  and the equilibrium contact angle  which is a function of the easily measurable advancing and receding contact angles (see main article contact angle)
this same relationship exists in the diagram on the right but in this case we see that because the contact angle is less than 90 the liquid-solid/solid-air surface tension difference must be negative:
==== special contact angles ====
observe that in the special case of a water-silver interface where the contact angle is equal to 90 the liquid-solid/solid-air surface tension difference is exactly zero
another special case is where the contact angle is exactly 180 water with specially prepared teflon approaches this contact angle of 180 occurs when the liquid-solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid-air surface tension
== methods of measurement ==
because surface tension manifests itself in various effects it offers a number of paths to its measurement which method is optimal depends upon the nature of the liquid being measured the conditions under which its tension is to be measured and the stability of its surface when it is deformed
du noy ring method: the traditional method used to measure surface or interfacial tension wetting properties of the surface or interface have little influence on this measuring technique maximum pull exerted on the ring by the surface is measured
du noy-padday method: a minimized version of du noy method uses a small diameter metal needle instead of a ring in combination with a high sensitivity microbalance to record maximum pull the advantage of this method is that very small sample volumes (down to few tens of microliters) can be measured with very high precision without the need to correct for buoyancy (for a needle or rather rod with proper geometry) further the measurement can be performed very quickly minimally in about 20 seconds first commercial multichannel tensiometers [cmceeker] were recently built based on this principle
wilhelmy plate method: a universal method especially suited to check surface tension over long time intervals a vertical plate of known perimeter is attached to a balance and the force due to wetting is measured
spinning drop method: this technique is ideal for measuring low interfacial tensions the diameter of a drop within a heavy phase is measured while both are rotated
pendant drop method: surface and interfacial tension can be measured by this technique even at elevated temperatures and pressures geometry of a drop is analyzed optically for details see drop
bubble pressure method (jaeger's method): a measurement technique for determining surface tension at short surface ages maximum pressure of each bubble is measured
drop volume method: a method for determining interfacial tension as a function of interface age liquid of one density is pumped into a second liquid of a different density and time between drops produced is measured
capillary rise method: the end of a capillary is immersed into the solution the height at which the solution reaches inside the capillary is related to the surface tension by the equation discussed below
stalagmometric method: a method of weighting and reading a drop of liquid
sessile drop method: a method for determining surface tension and density by placing a drop on a substrate and measuring the contact angle (see sessile drop technique)
vibrational frequency of levitated drops: the natural frequency of vibrational oscillations of magnetically levitated drops has been used to measure the surface tension of superfluid 4he this value is estimated to be 0.375 dyn/cm at t = 0 k
resonant oscillations of spherical and hemispherical liquid drop: the technique is based on measuring the resonant frequency of spherical and hemispherical pendant droplets driven in oscillations by a modulated electric field the surface tension and viscosity can be evaluated from the obtained resonant curves
== effects ==
=== liquid in a vertical tube ===
an old style mercury barometer consists of a vertical glass tube about 1 cm in diameter partially filled with mercury and with a vacuum (called torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right) notice that the mercury level at the center of the tube is higher than at the edges making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped the center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire crossection of the tube but the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus
we consider the surface area of the entire mass of mercury including the part of the surface that is in contact with the glass because mercury does not adhere to glass at all so the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area including where it is in contact with the glass if instead of glass the tube was made out of copper the situation would be very different mercury aggressively adheres to copper so in a copper tube the level of mercury at the center of the tube will be lower than at the edges (that is it would be a concave meniscus) in a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container we consider the part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension the fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area so in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy that decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container
if a tube is sufficiently narrow and the liquid adhesion to its walls is sufficiently strong surface tension can draw liquid up the tube in a phenomenon known as capillary action the height to which the column is lifted is given by:
where
is the height the liquid is lifted
is the liquid-air surface tension
is the density of the liquid
is the radius of the capillary
is the acceleration due to gravity
is the angle of contact described above if is greater than 90 as with mercury in a glass container the liquid will be depressed rather than lifted
=== puddles on a surface ===
pouring mercury onto a horizontal flat sheet of glass results in a puddle that has a perceptible thickness the puddle will spread out only to the point where it is a little under half a centimetre thick and no thinner again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension the liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible but the surface tension at the same time is acting to reduce the total surface area the result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness
the same surface tension demonstration can be done with water lime water or even saline but only on a surface made of a substance to which water does not adhere wax is such a substance water poured onto a smooth flat horizontal wax surface say a waxed sheet of glass will behave similarly to the mercury poured onto glass
the thickness of a puddle of liquid on a surface whose contact angle is 180 is given by:
where
in reality the thicknesses of the puddles will be slightly less than what is predicted by the above formula because very few surfaces have a contact angle of 180 with any liquid when the contact angle is less than 180 the thickness is given by:
for mercury on glass hg = 487 dyn/cm hg = 13.5 g/cm3 and = 140 which gives hhg = 0.36 cm for water on paraffin at 25 c = 72 dyn/cm = 1.0 g/cm3 and = 107 which gives hh2o = 0.44 cm
the formula also predicts that when the contact angle is 0 the liquid will spread out into a micro-thin layer over the surface such a surface is said to be fully wettable by the liquid
=== the breakup of streams into drops ===
in day-to-day life all of us observe that a stream of water emerging from a faucet will break up into droplets no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from the faucet this is due to a phenomenon called the plateaurayleigh instability which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension
the explanation of this instability begins with the existence of tiny perturbations in the stream these are always present no matter how smooth the stream is if the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time among those that grow with time some grow at faster rates than others whether a component decays or grows and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream
== thermodynamics ==
as stated above the mechanical work needed to increase a surface is  hence at constant temperature and pressure surface tension equals gibbs free energy per surface area:
where is gibbs free energy and is the area
thermodynamics requires that all spontaneous changes of state are accompanied by a decrease in gibbs free energy
from this it is easy to understand why decreasing the surface area of a mass of liquid is always spontaneous () provided it is not coupled to any other energy changes it follows that in order to increase surface area a certain amount of energy must be added
gibbs free energy is defined by the equation  where is enthalpy and is entropy based upon this and the fact that surface tension is gibbs free energy per unit area it is possible to obtain the following expression for entropy per unit area:
kelvin's equation for surfaces arises by rearranging the previous equations it states that surface enthalpy or surface energy (different from surface free energy) depends both on surface tension and its derivative with temperature at constant pressure by the relationship
=== thermodynamics of soap bubbles ===
the pressure inside an ideal (one surface) soap bubble can be derived from thermodynamic free energy considerations at constant temperature and particle number  the differential helmholtz energy is given by
where is the difference in pressure inside and outside of the bubble and is the surface tension in equilibrium  and so
for a spherical bubble the volume and surface area are given simply by
and
substituting these relations into the previous expression we find
which is equivalent to the younglaplace equation when rx = ry for real soap bubbles the pressure is doubled due to the presence of two interfaces one inside and one outside
==== influence of temperature ====
surface tension is dependent on temperature for that reason when a value is given for the surface tension of an interface temperature must be explicitly stated the general trend is that surface tension decreases with the increase of temperature reaching a value of 0 at the critical temperature for further details see etvs rule there are only empirical equations to relate surface tension and temperature:
etvs:
here v is the molar volume of a substance tc is the critical temperature and k is a constant valid for almost all substances a typical value is k = 2.1 x 107 [j k1 mol2/3] for water one can further use v = 18 ml/mol and tc = 374c
a variant on etvs is described by ramay and shields:
where the temperature offset of 6 kelvins provides the formula with a better fit to reality at lower temperatures
guggenheim-katayama:
is a constant for each liquid and n is an empirical factor whose value is 11/9 for organic liquids this equation was also proposed by van der waals who further proposed that could be given by the expression  where is a universal constant for all liquids and is the critical pressure of the liquid (although later experiments found to vary to some degree from one liquid to another)
both guggenheim-katayama and etvs take into account the fact that surface tension reaches 0 at the critical temperature whereas ramay and shields fails to match reality at this endpoint
==== influence of solute concentration ====
solutes can have different effects on surface tension depending on their structure:
little or no effect for example sugar
increase surface tension inorganic salts
decrease surface tension progressively alcohols
decrease surface tension and once a minimum is reached no more effect: surfactants
what complicates the effect is that a solute can exist in a different concentration at the surface of a solvent than in its bulk this difference varies from one solute/solvent combination to another
gibbs isotherm states that:
is known as surface concentration it represents excess of solute per unit area of the surface over what would be present if the bulk concentration prevailed all the way to the surface it has units of mol/m2
is the concentration of the substance in the bulk solution
is the gas constant and the temperature
certain assumptions are taken in its deduction therefore gibbs isotherm can only be applied to ideal (very dilute) solutions with two components
==== influence of particle size on vapor pressure ====
the clausiusclapeyron relation leads to another equation also attributed to kelvin as the kelvin equation it explains why because of surface tension the vapor pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension is greater than standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat that is to say that when a liquid is forming small droplets the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater this arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside
is the standard vapor pressure for that liquid at that temperature and pressure
is the molar volume
is the gas constant
is the kelvin radius the radius of the droplets
the effect explains supersaturation of vapors in the absence of nucleation sites tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets this requires a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase transition point
this equation is also used in catalyst chemistry to assess mesoporosity for solids
the effect can be viewed in terms of the average number of molecular neighbors of surface molecules (see diagram)
the table shows some calculated values of this effect for water at different drop sizes:
the effect becomes clear for very small drop sizes as a drop of 1 nm radius has about 100 molecules inside which is a quantity small enough to require a quantum mechanics analysis
