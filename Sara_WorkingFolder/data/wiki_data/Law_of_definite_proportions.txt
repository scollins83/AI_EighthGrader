in chemistry the law of definite proportions sometimes called proust's law or the law of definite composition states that a chemical compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by mass an equivalent statement is the law of constant composition which states that all samples of a given chemical compound have the same elemental composition by mass for example oxygen makes up about 8/9 of the mass of any sample of pure water while hydrogen makes up the remaining 1/9 of the mass along with the law of multiple proportions the law of definite proportions forms the basis of stoichiometry
== history ==
this observation was first made by the french chemist joseph proust based on several experiments conducted between 1798 and 1804 based on such observations proust made statements like this one in 1806:
i shall conclude by deducing from these experiments the principle i have established at the commencement of this memoir viz that iron like many other metals is subject to the law of nature which presides at every true combination that is to say that it unites with two constant proportions of oxygen in this respect it does not differ from tin mercury and lead and in a word almost every known combustible
the law of definite proportions might seem obvious to the modern chemist inherent in the very definition of a chemical compound at the end of the 18th century however when the concept of a chemical compound had not yet been fully developed the law was novel in fact when first proposed it was a controversial statement and was opposed by other chemists most notably proust's fellow frenchman claude louis berthollet who argued that the elements could combine in any proportion the existence of this debate demonstrates that at the time the distinction between pure chemical compounds and mixtures had not yet been fully developed
the law of definite proportions contributed to and was placed on a firm theoretical basis by the atomic theory that john dalton promoted beginning in 1803 which explained matter as consisting of discrete atoms that there was one type of atom for each element and that the compounds were made of combinations of different types of atoms in fixed proportions
a related early idea was prout's hypothesis formulated by english chemist william prout who proposed that the hydrogen atom was the fundamental atomic unit from this hypothesis was derived the whole number rule which was the rule of thumb that atomic masses were whole number multiples of the mass of hydrogen this was later rejected in the 1820s and 30s following more refined measurements of atomic mass notably by jns jacob berzelius which revealed in particular that the atomic mass of chlorine was 35.45 which was incompatible with the hypothesis since the 1920s this discrepancy has been explained by the presence of isotopes; the atomic mass of any isotope is very close to satisfying the whole number rule with the mass defect caused by differing binding energies being significantly smaller
== non-stoichiometric compounds ==
although very useful in the foundation of modern chemistry the law of definite proportions is not universally true there exist non-stoichiometric compounds whose elemental composition can vary from sample to sample an example is the iron oxide wstite which can contain between 0.83 and 0.95 iron atoms for every oxygen atom and thus contain anywhere between 23% and 25% oxygen by mass the ideal formula is feo but due to crystallographic vacancies it is reduced to about fe0.95o in general proust's measurements were not accurate enough to detect such variations
in addition the isotopic composition of an element can vary depending on its source hence its contribution to the mass of even a pure stoichiometric compound may vary this variation is used in geochemical dating since astronomical atmospheric oceanic crustal and deep earth processes may concentrate lighter or heavier isotopes preferentially with the exception of hydrogen and its isotopes the effect is usually small but is measurable with modern instrumentation
an additional note: many natural polymers vary in composition (for instance dna proteins carbohydrates) even when "pure" polymers are generally not considered "pure chemical compounds" except when their molecular weight is uniform (monodisperse) and their stoichiometry is constant in this unusual case they still may violate the law due to isotopic variations
