acid rock got its name because it served as "background" music for acid trips in underground parties in the 1960s (e.g the merry pranksters' "acid tests") in an interview with rolling stone jerry garcia quoted grateful dead band member phil lesh stating "acid rock is what you listen to when you are high on acid." garcia further stated there is no real psychedelic rock and that it is indian classical music and some tibetan music that are examples of music "designed to expand consciousness."

generally the term "acid rock" is roughly equivalent to and has often been used interchangeably with psychedelic rock with "acid rock" usually defining psychedelic rock with a harder heavier attack alan bisbort and parke puterbaugh write that acid rock "can best be described as psychedelia at its rawest and most intense [...] bad trips as well as good riots as well as peace pain as well as pleasure - the whole spectrum of reality not just the idyllic bits were captured by acid rock." psychedelic rock and "acid rock" also significantly overlapped with the raw energetic "fuzzy" sound of "garage rock" (or "proto-punk") in the early to mid 1960s as exemplified in the compilation album nuggets: original artyfacts from the first psychedelic era 1965-1968 with "garage rock" bands playing psychedelic rock with the rawness and distortion of "garage rock."
when hard rock and heavy metal became prominent in the early and mid-1970s the phrase "acid rock" was sometimes applied to these genres with "acid rock" often referring to early "heavy metal" music a genre which at its earliest stages had more evident "psychedelic" influence over time heavier bands that had originally been defined as "acid rock," such as alice cooper and black sabbath fell in under the term "heavy metal," which eventually replaced "acid rock" as the name for their style of music
