early in pope's career he published a paper that made him an academic cornerstone of environmental science and policy called "respiratory hospital admissions associated with pm10 pollution in utah salt lake and cache valleys" in utah valley the geneva steel mill generated large quantities of particulate matter which is a byproduct of fossil fuel consumption the mill was shut down temporarily pope compiled hospital admissions data for the time before during and after the temporary closing of the mill and was the first to convincingly show the immediate health harms associated with atmospheric particulate matter asthma mortality and respiratory admissions generally were twice as high while the plant was operating than the year in which it was closed utah made a particularly suitable natural experiment as the various valleys included in the study trap pollution in the winter months when temperature inversions stifle the escape of pollution his abstract states:
pope came under hostile political pressure and his findings became a firestorm of controversy intense scrutiny revealed that his results were accurate in 2004 pope was awarded the utah governor's medal in science and technology in 2007 dr pope was recognized as byu's distinguished faculty through reception of the karl g maeser award
