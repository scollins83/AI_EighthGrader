the greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature above what it would be in the absence of its atmosphere if a planet's atmosphere contains radiatively active gases (i.e. greenhouse gases) the atmosphere radiates energy in all directions part of this radiation is directed towards the surface warming it
on earth solar radiation at the frequencies of visible light largely passes through the atmosphere to warm the planetary surface the surface itself emits energy at the lower frequencies of infrared thermal radiation infrared radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere these gases also radiate energy some of which is directed to the surface and lower atmosphere the mechanism is named after the effect of solar radiation passing through glass and warming a greenhouse but the way it retains heat is fundamentally different as a greenhouse works by reducing airflow isolating the warm air inside the structure so that heat is not lost by convection
if an ideal thermally conductive blackbody were the same distance from the sun as the earth is it would have a temperature of about 5.3 c however since the earth reflects about 30% of the incoming sunlight this idealized planet's effective temperature (the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same amount of radiation) would be about 18 c the surface temperature of this hypothetical planet is 33 c below earth's actual surface temperature of approximately 14 c the mechanism that produces this difference between the actual surface temperature and the effective temperature is due to the atmosphere and is known as the greenhouse effect
earths natural greenhouse effect is critical to supporting life human activities primarily the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests have intensified the natural greenhouse effect causing global warming
== historyedit ==
the existence of the greenhouse effect was argued for by joseph fourier in 1824 the argument and the evidence was further strengthened by claude pouillet in 1827 and 1838 and reasoned from experimental observations by john tyndall in 1859 the effect was more fully quantified by svante arrhenius in 1896 however the term "greenhouse" wasn't used to describe the effect by any of these scientists; the term was first used in this way by nils gustaf ekholm in 1901
in 1917 alexander graham bell wrote "[the unchecked burning of fossil fuels] would have a sort of greenhouse effect" and "the net result is the greenhouse becomes a sort of hot-house." bell went on to also advocate the use of alternate energy sources such as solar energy

the earth receives energy from the sun in the form uv visible and near ir radiation most of which passes through the atmosphere without being absorbed or reflected of the total amount of energy available at the top of the atmosphere (toa) about 26% is reflected back out to space by the atmosphere and clouds and 19% is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the earth's surface because it is warm the surface radiates far ir thermal radiation that consists of wavelengths that are much longer than the wavelengths that were absorbed (the overlap between the incident solar spectrum and the terrestrial thermal spectrum is small enough to be neglected for most purposes) most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere thereby warming it (in addition to sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface) the atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the part radiated downwards is absorbed by the earth's surface this leads to a higher equilibrium temperature than if the atmosphere were absent
the basic mechanism can be qualified in a number of ways none of which affect the fundamental process the atmosphere near the surface is largely opaque to thermal radiation (with important exceptions for "window" bands) and most heat loss from the surface is by sensible heat and latent heat transport radiative energy losses become increasingly important higher in the atmosphere largely because of the decreasing concentration of water vapor an important greenhouse gas it is more realistic to think of the greenhouse effect as applying to a "surface" in the mid-troposphere which is effectively coupled to the surface by a lapse rate the simple picture also assumes a steady state but in the real world there are variations due to the diurnal cycle as well as the seasonal cycle and weather disturbances solar heating only applies during daytime during the night the atmosphere cools somewhat but not greatly because its emissivity is low diurnal temperature changes decrease with height in the atmosphere
within the region where radiative effects are important the description given by the idealized greenhouse model becomes realistic: the surface of the earth warmed to a temperature around 255 k radiates long-wavelength infrared heat in the range 4100 m at these wavelengths greenhouse gases that were largely transparent to incoming solar radiation are more absorbent each layer of atmosphere with greenhouses gases absorbs some of the heat being radiated upwards from lower layers it re-radiates in all directions both upwards and downwards; in equilibrium (by definition) the same amount as it has absorbed this results in more warmth below increasing the concentration of the gases increases the amount of absorption and re-radiation and thereby further warms the layers and ultimately the surface below
greenhouse gasesincluding most diatomic gases with two different atoms (such as carbon monoxide co) and all gases with three or more atomsare able to absorb and emit infrared radiation though more than 99% of the dry atmosphere is ir transparent (because the main constituentsn2 o2 and arare not able to directly absorb or emit infrared radiation) intermolecular collisions cause the energy absorbed and emitted by the greenhouse gases to be shared with the other non-ir-active gases
== greenhouse gasesedit ==
by their percentage contribution to the greenhouse effect on earth the four major gases are:
water vapor 3670%
carbon dioxide 926%
methane 49%
ozone 37%
it is not physically realistic to assign a specific percentage to each gas because the absorption and emission bands of the gases overlap (hence the ranges given above) the major non-gas contributor to the earth's greenhouse effect clouds also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on radiative properties of the atmosphere
== role in climate changeedit ==
strengthening of the greenhouse effect through human activities is known as the enhanced (or anthropogenic) greenhouse effect this increase in radiative forcing from human activity is attributable mainly to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels according to the latest assessment report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change "atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years their effects together with those of other anthropogenic drivers have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century"
co2 is produced by fossil fuel burning and other activities such as cement production and tropical deforestation measurements of co2 from the mauna loa observatory show that concentrations have increased from about 313 ppm in 1960 to about 389 ppm in 2010 it reached the 400ppm milestone on may 9 2013 the current observed amount of co2 exceeds the geological record maxima (~300 ppm) from ice core data the effect of combustion-produced carbon dioxide on the global climate a special case of the greenhouse effect first described in 1896 by svante arrhenius has also been called the callendar effect
over the past 800,000 years ice core data shows that carbon dioxide has varied from values as low as 180 parts per million (ppm) to the pre-industrial level of 270ppm paleoclimatologists consider variations in carbon dioxide concentration to be a fundamental factor influencing climate variations over this time scale
== real greenhousesedit ==
the "greenhouse effect" of the atmosphere is named by analogy to greenhouses which get warmer in sunlight the explanation given in most sources for the warmer temperature in an actual greenhouse is that incident solar radiation in the visible long-wavelength ultraviolet and short-wavelength infrared range of the spectrum passes through the glass roof and walls and is absorbed by the floor earth and contents which become warmer and re-emit the energy as longer-wavelength infrared radiation glass and other materials used for greenhouse walls do not transmit infrared radiation so the infrared cannot escape via radiative transfer as the structure is not open to the atmosphere heat also cannot escape via convection so the temperature inside the greenhouse rises the greenhouse effect due to infrared-opaque "greenhouse gases" including carbon dioxide and methane instead of glass also affects the earth as a whole; there is no convective cooling as air does not escape from the earth
however a significant experiment suggests that the mechanism by which the atmosphere retains heatthe "greenhouse effect"is different; a greenhouse is not primarily warmed by the "greenhouse effect" a greenhouse works primarily by allowing sunlight to warm surfaces inside the structure but then preventing absorbed heat from leaving the structure through convection the "greenhouse effect" heats the earth because greenhouse gases absorb outgoing radiative energy heating the atmosphere which then emits radiative energy with some of it going back towards the earth
a greenhouse is built of any material that passes sunlight usually glass or plastic it mainly warms up because the sun warms the ground and contents inside which then warms the air in the greenhouse the air continues to heat because it is confined within the greenhouse unlike the environment outside the greenhouse where warm air near the surface rises and mixes with cooler air aloft this can be demonstrated by opening a small window near the roof of a greenhouse: the temperature will drop considerably it was demonstrated experimentally (r w wood 1909) that a "greenhouse" with a cover of rock salt (which is transparent to infra red) heats up an enclosure similarly to one with a glass cover thus greenhouses work primarily by preventing convective cooling
more recent quantitative studies suggest that the effect of infrared radiative cooling is not negligibly small and may have economic implications in a heated greenhouse analysis of issues of near-infrared radiation in a greenhouse with screens of a high coefficient of reflection concluded that installation of such screens reduced heat demand by about 8% and application of dyes to transparent surfaces was suggested composite less-reflective glass or less effective but cheaper anti-reflective coated simple glass also produced savings
in contrast the greenhouse effect heats the earth because rather than retaining (sensible) heat by physically preventing movement of the air greenhouse gases act to warm the earth by re-radiating some of the energy back towards the surface this process may exist in real greenhouses but is comparatively unimportant there

in the solar system there also greenhouse effects on mars venus and titan; that on venus is particularly large due to its atmosphere which consists mainly of dense carbon dioxide titan has an anti-greenhouse effect in that its atmosphere absorbs solar radiation but is relatively transparent to infrared radiation pluto is also colder than would be expected because evaporation of nitrogen cools it
a runaway greenhouse effect occurs if positive feedbacks lead to the evaporation of all greenhouse gases into the atmosphere a runaway greenhouse effect involving carbon dioxide and water vapor is thought to have occurred on venus
