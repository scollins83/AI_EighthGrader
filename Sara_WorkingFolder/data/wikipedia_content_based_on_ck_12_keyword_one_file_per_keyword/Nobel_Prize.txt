the nobel prize (swedish pronunciation: [nbl] swedish definite form singular: nobelpriset; norwegian: nobelprisen) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by swedish and norwegian committees in recognition of academic cultural and/or scientific advances the will of the swedish inventor alfred nobel established the prizes in 1895 the prizes in chemistry literature peace physics and physiology or medicine were first awarded in 1901 the related nobel memorial prize in economic sciences was established by sweden's central bank in 1968 the nobel prize itself was made of the mixture of gold and silver with 24 carat or 4.8 g gold coating between 1901 and 2015 the nobel prizes and the prize in economic sciences were awarded 573 times to 900 people and organizations with some receiving the nobel prize more than once this makes a total of 870 individuals (821 men and 49 women) and 23 organizations
the prizes are awarded in stockholm sweden except for the peace prize which is awarded in oslo norway the nobel prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in the fields of literature medicine physics chemistry peace and economics
the royal swedish academy of sciences awards the nobel prize in physics the nobel prize in chemistry and the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences; the nobel assembly at karolinska institutet awards the nobel prize in physiology or medicine; the swedish academy grants the nobel prize in literature; and the nobel peace prize is awarded not by a swedish organisation but by the norwegian nobel committee
the various prizes are awarded yearly each recipient or laureate receives a gold medal a diploma and a sum of money which is decided by the nobel foundation as of 2012 each prize was worth 8 million sek (c us$1.2 million 0.93 million 0.6 million) the prize is not awarded posthumously; however if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it the prize may still be presented though the average number of laureates per prize increased substantially during the 20th century a prize may not be shared among more than three people
== history ==
alfred nobel ( listen ) was born on 21 october 1833 in stockholm sweden into a family of engineers he was a chemist engineer and inventor in 1894 nobel purchased the bofors iron and steel mill which he made into a major armaments manufacturer nobel also invented ballistite this invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives especially the british smokeless powder cordite as a consequence of his patent claims nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime with most of his wealth from his 355 inventions of which dynamite is the most famous
in 1888 nobel was astonished to read his own obituary titled the merchant of death is dead in a french newspaper as it was alfred's brother ludvig who had died the obituary was eight years premature the article disconcerted nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered this inspired him to change his will on 10 december 1896 alfred nobel died in his villa in san remo italy from a cerebral haemorrhage he was 63 years old
nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime he composed the last over a year before he died signing it at the swedishnorwegian club in paris on 27 november 1895 to widespread astonishment nobel's last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in physics chemistry physiology or medicine literature and peace nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets 31 million sek (c us$186 million 150 million in 2008) to establish the five nobel prizes because of scepticism surrounding the will it was not until 26 april 1897 that it was approved by the storting in norway the executors of nobel's will ragnar sohlman and rudolf lilljequist formed the nobel foundation to take care of nobel's fortune and organise the award of prizes
nobel's instructions named a norwegian nobel committee to award the peace prize the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in april 1897 soon thereafter the other prize-awarding organisations were designated or established these were karolinska institutet on 7 june the swedish academy on 9 june and the royal swedish academy of sciences on 11 june the nobel foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and in 1900 the nobel foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by king oscar ii in 1905 the personal union between sweden and norway was dissolved
=== nobel foundation ===
the nobel foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 june 1900 its function is to manage the finances and administration of the nobel prizes in accordance with nobel's will the primary task of the foundation is to manage the fortune nobel left robert and ludwig nobel were involved in the oil business in azerbaijan and according to swedish historian e bargengren who accessed the nobel family archives it was this "decision to allow withdrawal of alfred's money from baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the nobel prizes to be established" another important task of the nobel foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes the foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the nobel laureates in many ways the nobel foundation is similar to an investment company in that it invests nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities the nobel foundation is exempt from all taxes in sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the united states (since 1953) since the 1980s the foundation's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 december 2007 the assets controlled by the nobel foundation amounted to 3.628 billion swedish kronor (c us$560 million)
according to the statutes the foundation consists of a board of five swedish or norwegian citizens with its seat in stockholm the chairman of the board is appointed by the swedish king in council with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions an executive director is chosen from among the board members a deputy director is appointed by the king in council and two deputies are appointed by the trustees however since 1995 all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees and the executive director and the deputy director appointed by the board itself as well as the board the nobel foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the royal swedish academy of sciences the nobel assembly at karolinska institute the swedish academy and the norwegian nobel committee) the trustees of these institutions and auditors
=== first prizes ===
once the nobel foundation and its guidelines were in place the nobel committees began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes subsequently they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions
the nobel committee's physics prize shortlist cited wilhelm rntgen's discovery of x-rays and philipp lenard's work on cathode rays the academy of sciences selected rntgen for the prize in the last decades of the 19th century many chemists had made significant contributions thus with the chemistry prize the academy "was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize." the academy received 20 nominations eleven of them for jacobus van't hoff van't hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in chemical thermodynamics
the swedish academy chose the poet sully prudhomme for the first nobel prize in literature a group including 42 swedish writers artists and literary critics protested against this decision having expected leo tolstoy to be awarded some including burton feldman have criticised this prize because they consider prudhomme a mediocre poet feldman's explanation is that most of the academy members preferred victorian literature and thus selected a victorian poet the first physiology or medicine prize went to the german physiologist and microbiologist emil von behring during the 1890s von behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year
=== second world war ===
in 1938 and 1939 adolf hitler's third reich forbade three laureates from germany (richard kuhn adolf friedrich johann butenandt and gerhard domagk) from accepting their prizes each man was later able to receive the diploma and medal even though sweden was officially neutral during the second world war the prizes were awarded irregularly in 1939 the peace prize was not awarded no prize was awarded in any category from 194042 due to the occupation of norway by germany in the subsequent year all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace
during the occupation of norway three members of the norwegian nobel committee fled into exile the remaining members escaped persecution from the germans when the nobel foundation stated that the committee building in oslo was swedish property thus it was a safe haven from the german military which was not at war with sweden these members kept the work of the committee going but did not award any prizes in 1944 the nobel foundation together with the three members in exile made sure that nominations were submitted for the peace prize and that the prize could be awarded once again
=== prize in economic sciences ===
in 1968 sveriges riksbank celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the nobel foundation to be used to set up a prize in honor of nobel the following year the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences was awarded for the first time the royal swedish academy of sciences became responsible for selecting laureates the first laureates for the economics prize were jan tinbergen and ragnar frisch "for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes." although not a nobel prize it is intimately identified with the other awards; the laureates are announced with the nobel prize recipients and the prize in economic sciences is presented at the swedish nobel prize award ceremony the board of the nobel foundation decided that after this addition it would allow no further new prizes
== award process ==
the award process is similar for all of the nobel prizes; the main difference is in who can make nominations for each of them
=== nominations ===
nomination forms are sent by the nobel committee to about 3,000 individuals usually in september the year before the prizes are awarded these individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area regarding the peace prize inquiries are also sent to governments former peace prize laureates and current or former members of the norwegian nobel committee the deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 january of the year of the award the nobel committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names the nominees are not publicly named nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize all nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize
=== selection ===
the nobel committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields this along with the list of preliminary candidates is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions the institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote their decision which cannot be appealed is announced immediately after the vote a maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award except for the peace prize which can be awarded to institutions the awards can only be given to individuals if the peace prize is not awarded the money is split among the scientific prizes this has happened 19 times so far
=== posthumous nominations ===
although posthumous nominations are not presently permitted individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize this has occurred twice: the 1931 literature prize awarded to erik axel karlfeldt and the 1961 peace prize awarded to un secretary general dag hammarskjld since 1974 laureates must be thought alive at the time of the october announcement there has been one laureate william vickrey who in 1996 died after the prize (in economics) was announced but before it could be presented on 3 october 2011 the laureates for the nobel prize in physiology or medicine were announced; however the committee was not aware that one of the laureates ralph m steinman had died three days earlier the committee was debating about steinman's prize since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously the committee later decided that as the decision to award steinman the prize "was made in good faith" it would remain unchanged
=== recognition time lag ===
nobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made "during the preceding year" early on the awards usually recognised recent discoveries however some of these early discoveries were later discredited for example johannes fibiger was awarded the 1926 prize for physiology or medicine for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer to avoid repeating this embarrassment the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time according to ralf pettersson former chairman of the nobel prize committee for physiology or medicine "the criterion 'the previous year' is interpreted by the nobel assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident."
the interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline the literature prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement the peace prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work for example 2008 laureate martti ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts however they can also be awarded for specific recent events for instance kofi annan was awarded the 2001 peace prize just four years after becoming the secretary-general of the united nations similarly yasser arafat yitzhak rabin and shimon peres received the 1994 award about a year after they successfully concluded the oslo accords
although nobel's will stated that prizes should be awarded for contributions made "during the preceding year" awards for physics chemistry and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted sometimes this takes decades for example subrahmanyan chandrasekhar shared the 1983 physics prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised some discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realised after the discoverers have died
== award ceremonies ==
except for the peace prize the nobel prizes are presented in stockholm sweden at the annual prize award ceremony on 10 december the anniversary of nobel's death the recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony the peace prize and its recipients' lectures are presented at the annual prize award ceremony in oslo norway usually on 10 december the award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events the prizes awarded in sweden's ceremonies' are held at the stockholm concert hall with the nobel banquet following immediately at stockholm city hall the nobel peace prize ceremony has been held at the norwegian nobel institute (19051946) at the auditorium of the university of oslo (19471989) and at oslo city hall (1990present)
the highlight of the nobel prize award ceremony in stockholm occurs when each nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the king of sweden in oslo the chairman of the norwegian nobel committee presents the nobel peace prize in the presence of the king of norway at first king oscar ii did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners it is said that his mind changed once his attention had been drawn to the publicity value of the prizes for sweden
=== nobel banquet ===
after the award ceremony in sweden a banquet is held in the blue hall at the stockholm city hall which is attended by the swedish royal family and around 1,300 guests
the nobel peace prize banquet is held in norway at the oslo grand hotel after the award ceremony apart from the laureate guests include the president of the storting the prime minister and since 2006 the king and queen of norway in total about 250 guests attend
=== nobel lecture ===
according to the statutes of the nobel foundation each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize the nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format these lectures normally occur during nobel week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet which begins with the laureates arriving in stockholm and normally ends with the nobel banquet) but this is not mandatory the laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize some have happened even later for example u.s president theodore roosevelt received the peace prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910 after his term in office the lectures are organized by the same association which selected the laureates
== prizes ==
=== medals ===
it was announced on 30 may 2012 that the nobel foundation had awarded the contract for the production of the five (swedish) nobel prize medals to svenska medalj ab formerly the nobel prize medals were minted by myntverket (the swedish mint) from 1902 to 2010 myntverket sweden's oldest company ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years in 2011 the mint of norway located in kongsberg made the medals the nobel prize medals are registered trademarks of the nobel foundation each medal features an image of alfred nobel in left profile on the obverse the medals for physics chemistry physiology or medicine and literature have identical obverses showing the image of alfred nobel and the years of his birth and death nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the peace prize medal and the medal for the economics prize but with a slightly different design for instance the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the economics medal the image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize the reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design
all medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold since then they have been struck in 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold the weight of each medal varies with the value of gold but averages about 175 grams (0.386 lb) for each medal the diameter is 66 millimetres (2.6 in) and the thickness varies between 5.2 millimetres (0.20 in) and 2.4 millimetres (0.094 in) because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display nobel medals are subject to medal theft during world war ii the medals of german scientists max von laue and james franck were sent to copenhagen for safekeeping when germany invaded denmark chemist george de hevesy dissolved them in aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid) to prevent confiscation by nazi germany and to prevent legal problems for the holders after the war the gold was recovered from solution and the medals re-cast
=== diplomas ===
nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the king of sweden or in the case of the peace prize the chairman of the norwegian nobel committee each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them the diploma contains a picture and text in swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize none of the nobel peace prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas
=== award money ===
the laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded the amount of prize money depends upon how much money the nobel foundation can award each year the purse has increased since the 1980s when the prize money was 880 000 sek (c 2.6 million sek us$350 000 or 295,000 today) per prize in 2009 the monetary award was 10 million sek (us$1.4 million 950,000) in june 2012 it was lowered to 8 million sek if there are two laureates in a particular category the award grant is divided equally between the recipients if there are three the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others it is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific cultural or humanitarian causes
== controversies and criticisms ==
=== controversial recipients ===
among other criticisms the nobel committees have been accused of having a political agenda and of omitting more deserving candidates they have also been accused of eurocentrism especially for the literature prize
peace prize
among the most criticised nobel peace prizes was the one awarded to henry kissinger and l c th this led to the resignation of two norwegian nobel committee members l c th declined the prize kissinger and th were awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between north vietnam and the united states in january 1973 however when the award was announced both sides were still engaging in hostilities many critics were of the opinion that kissinger was not a peace-maker but the opposite responsible for widening the war
yasser arafat shimon peres and yitzhak rabin received the peace prize in 1994 for their efforts in making peace between israel and palestine immediately after the award was announced one of the five norwegian nobel committee members denounced arafat as a terrorist and resigned additional misgivings about arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers
another controversial peace prize was that awarded to barack obama in 2009 nominations had closed only eleven days after obama took office as president but the actual evaluation occurred over the next eight months obama himself stated that he did not feel deserving of the award or worthy of the company it would place him in past peace prize laureates were divided some saying that obama deserved the award and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade obama's award along with the previous peace prizes for jimmy carter and al gore also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias
literature prize
the award of the 2004 literature prize to elfriede jelinek drew a protest from a member of the swedish academy knut ahnlund ahnlund resigned alleging that the selection of jelinek had caused "irreparable damage to all progressive forces it has also confused the general view of literature as an art." he alleged that jelinek's works were "a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure." the 2009 literature prize to herta mller also generated criticism according to the washington post many us literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work this made those critics feel the prizes were too eurocentric
science prizes
in 1949 the neurologist antnio egas moniz received the physiology or medicine prize for his development of the prefrontal leucotomy the previous year dr walter freeman had developed a version of the procedure which was faster and easier to carry out due in part to the publicity surrounding the original procedure freeman's procedure was prescribed without due consideration or regard for modern medical ethics endorsed by such influential publications as the new england journal of medicine leucotomy or "lobotomy" became so popular that about 5,000 lobotomies were performed in the united states in the three years immediately following moniz's receipt of the prize
=== overlooked achievements ===
the norwegian nobel committee confirmed that mahatma gandhi was nominated for the peace prize in 193739 1947 and a few days before he was assassinated in january 1948 later members of the norwegian nobel committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize geir lundestad secretary of norwegian nobel committee in 2006 said "the greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that mahatma gandhi never received the nobel peace prize gandhi could do without the nobel peace prize whether nobel committee can do without gandhi is the question" in 1948 the year of gandhi's death the nobel committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that "there was no suitable living candidate" that year later when the dalai lama was awarded the peace prize in 1989 the chairman of the committee said that this was "in part a tribute to the memory of mahatma gandhi." other high profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out foreign policy lists eleanor roosevelt vclav havel ken saro-wiwa sari nusseibeh and corazon aquino as people who "never won the prize but should have." the physicist arnold sommerfeld was nominated 81 times but an award was never made
in 1965 un secretary general u thant was informed by the norwegian permananent representative to the un that he would be awarded that year's prize and asked whether or not he would accept he consulted staff and later replied that he would at the same time chairman gunnar jahn of the nobel peace prize committee lobbied heavily against giving u thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to unicef the rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to u thant for his work in defusing the cuban missile crisis ending the war in the congo and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the vietnam war the disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given with gunnar jahn effectively vetoing an award to u thant
the literature prize also has controversial omissions adam kirsch has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra-literary reasons the heavy focus on european and swedish authors has been a subject of criticism the eurocentric nature of the award was acknowledged by peter englund the 2009 permanent secretary of the swedish academy as a problem with the award and was attributed to the tendency for the academy to relate more to european authors this tendency towards european authors still leaves a number of european writers on a list of notable writers that have been overlooked for the literature prize including europe's leo tolstoy anton chekhov j r r tolkien mile zola marcel proust vladimir nabokov james joyce august strindberg simon vestdijk the new world's jorge luis borges ezra pound john updike arthur miller mark twain and africa's chinua achebe
the strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial when a prize is awarded to recognize an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators one or more will miss out for example in 2002 the prize was awarded to koichi tanaka and john fenn for the development of mass spectrometry in protein chemistry an award that did not recognize the achievements of franz hillenkamp and michael karas of the institute for physical and theoretical chemistry at the university of frankfurt according to one of the nominees for the prize in physics the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013: the team of carl hagen gerald guralnik and tom kibble published a paper in 1964 that gave answers to how the cosmos began but did not share the 2013 physics prize awarded to peter higgs and franois englert who had also published papers in 1964 concerning the subject all five physicists arrived at the same conclusion albeit from different angles hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three limit restriction or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years
similarly the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded in 1962 francis crick james d watson and maurice wilkins were awarded the physiology or medicine prize for discovering the structure of dna rosalind franklin a key contributor in that discovery died of ovarian cancer four years earlier the economics prize was not awarded to fischer black who died in 1995 when his co-author myron scholes received the honor in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with robert c merton another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options in the announcement of the award that year the nobel committee prominently mentioned black's key role
political subterfuge may also deny proper recognition lise meitner and fritz strassmann who co-discovered nuclear fission along with otto hahn may have been denied a share of hahn's 1944 nobel chemistry award due to having fled germany when the nazis came to power the meitner and strassmann roles in the research was not fully recognized until years later when they joined hahn in receiving the 1966 enrico fermi award
=== emphasis on discoveries over inventions ===
alfred nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded "to those who during the preceding year shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind." he stated that the nobel prizes in physics should be given "to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics." nobel did not emphasise discoveries but they have historically been held in higher respect by the nobel prize committee than inventions: 77% of the physics prizes have been given to discoveries compared with only 23% to inventions christoph bartneck and matthias rauterberg in papers published in nature and technoetic arts have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the nobel prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society
== specially distinguished laureates ==
=== multiple laureates ===
four people have received two nobel prizes marie curie received the physics prize in 1903 for her work on radioactivity and the chemistry prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure radium making her the only person to win a nobel prize in two different sciences linus pauling won the 1954 chemistry prize for his research into the chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex substances pauling also won the peace prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes john bardeen received the physics prize twice: in 1956 for the invention of the transistor and in 1972 for the theory of superconductivity frederick sanger received the prize twice in chemistry: in 1958 for determining the structure of the insulin molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in dna
two organisations have received the peace prize multiple times the international committee of the red cross received it three times: in 1917 and 1944 for its work during the world wars; and in 1963 during the year of its centenary the united nations high commissioner for refugees has won the peace prize twice for assisting refugees: in 1954 and 1981
=== family laureates ===
the curie family has received the most prizes with five marie curie received the prizes in physics (in 1903) and chemistry (in 1911) her husband pierre curie shared the 1903 physics prize with her their daughter irne joliot-curie received the chemistry prize in 1935 together with her husband frdric joliot-curie in addition the husband of marie curie's second daughter henry labouisse was the director of unicef when it won the nobel peace prize in 1965
although no family matches the curie family's record there have been several with two laureates the husband-and-wife team of gerty cori and carl ferdinand cori shared the 1947 prize in physiology or medicine as did the husband-and-wife team of may-britt moser and edvard moser in 2014 (along with john o'keefe) j j thomson was awarded the physics prize in 1906 for showing that electrons are particles his son george paget thomson received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves william henry bragg and his son william lawrence bragg shared the physics prize in 1915 for inventing the x-ray spectrometer niels bohr won the physics prize in 1922 as did his son aage bohr in 1975 manne siegbahn who received the physics prize in 1924 was the father of kai siegbahn who received the physics prize in 1981 hans von euler-chelpin who received the chemistry prize in 1929 was the father of ulf von euler who was awarded the physiology or medicine prize in 1970 c.v raman won the physics prize in 1930 and was the uncle of subrahmanyan chandrasekhar who won the same prize in 1983 arthur kornberg received the physiology or medicine prize in 1959 kornberg's son roger later received the chemistry prize in 2006 jan tinbergen who won the first economics prize in 1969 was the brother of nikolaas tinbergen who received the 1973 physiology or medicine prize alva myrdal peace prize laureate in 1982 was the wife of gunnar myrdal who was awarded the economics prize in 1974 economics laureates paul samuelson and kenneth arrow were brothers-in-law
== cultural impact ==
being a symbol of scientific or literary achievement that's recognisable worldwide the nobel prize is often depicted in fiction this includes films like the prize and nobel son about fictional nobel laureates as well as fictionalized accounts of stories surrounding real prizes such as nobel chor a film based on the unsolved theft of rabindranath tagore's prize
== refusals and constraints ==
two laureates have voluntarily declined the nobel prize in 1964 jean-paul sartre was awarded the literature prize but refused stating "a writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution even if it takes place in the most honourable form." the other is l c th chosen for the 1973 peace prize for his role in the paris peace accords he declined stating that there was no actual peace in vietnam
during the third reich adolf hitler hindered richard kuhn adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk from accepting their prizes all of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after world war ii in 1958 boris pasternak declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the soviet union government might do if he travelled to stockholm to accept his prize in return the swedish academy refused his refusal saying "this refusal of course in no way alters the validity of the award." the academy announced with regret that the presentation of the literature prize could not take place that year holding it until 1989 when pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf aung san suu kyi was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1991 but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in burma; suu kyi delivered her speech two decades later in 2012 liu xiaobo was awarded the nobel peace prize in 2010 while he and his wife were under house arrest in china as political prisoners
== legacy ==
the memorial symbol "planet of alfred nobel" was opened in dnipropetrovsk university of economics and law in 2008 on the globe there are 802 nobel laureates' reliefs made of a composite alloy obtained when disposing of military strategic missiles
