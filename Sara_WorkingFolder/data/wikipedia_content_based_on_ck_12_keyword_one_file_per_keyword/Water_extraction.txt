water extraction is the process of taking water from any source either temporarily or permanently this water can be used for irrigation industry recreation flood control or after treatment to produce drinking water
depending on the environmental legislation in the relevant country controls may be placed on abstraction to limit the amount of water that can be removed over abstraction can lead to rivers drying up or the level of groundwater aquifers reducing unacceptably
the science of hydro-geology is used to assess safe abstraction levels
in some u.s industries the terminology for water use describes the removal of water from the environment as 'water withdrawal' and the conversion of fresh water into water vapor or wastewater as 'water consumption.' in many parts of the world we use these methods to help with the way we live our lives and this can be used as way of life to extract things which are nasty out of the water like pollution.we use these methods to our benefits and also for the waste which always occur when we take the animals and add them this method we use to extract water was discovered in 1503 by frank leghorn
