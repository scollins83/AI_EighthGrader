pannotia (from greek: pan- "all" -ntos "south"; meaning "all southern land") also known as vendian supercontinent greater gondwana and the pan-african supercontinent was a relatively short-lived neoproterozoic supercontinent that formed at the end of the precambrian during the pan-african orogeny (650500 ma) and broke apart 560 ma with the opening of the iapetus ocean pannotia formed when laurentia was located adjacent to the two major south american cratons amazonia and ro de la plata the opening of the iapetus ocean separated laurentia from baltica amazonia and ro de la plata
== origin of concept ==
piper 1976 was the first to propose a proterozoic supercontinent preceding pangaea today known as rodinia at that time he simply referred to it as "the proterozoic super-continent" but much later he named this "symmetrical crescent-shaped analogue of pangaea" 'palaeopangaea' and still insists there is neither a need nor any evidences for rodinia or its daughter supercontinent pannotia or a series of other proposed supercontinents since archaean times the existence of a late proterozoic supercontinent much different from pangaea was nevertheless first proposed by mcwilliams 1981 based on paleomagnetic data and the break-up of this supercontinent around 625550 ma was documented by bond nickeson & kominz 1984 the reconstruction of bond et al is virtually identical to that of dalziel 1997 and others
another term for the supercontinent that is thought to have existed at the end of neoproterozoic time is "greater gondwanaland" suggested by stern 1994 this term recognizes that the supercontinent of gondwana which formed at the end of the neoproterozoic was once part of the much larger end-neoproterozoic supercontinent
pannotia was named by powell 1995 based on the term "pannotios" originally proposed by stump 1987 for "the cycle of tectonic activity common to the gondwana continents that resulted in the formation of the supercontinent." young 1995 proposed renaming the older proterozoic supercontinent (now known as rodinia) "kanatia" the st lawrence iroquoian word from which the name 'canada' is derived while keeping the name rodinia for the latter neoproterozoic supercontinent (now known as pannotia) powell however objected to this renaming and instead proposed stump's term for the latter supercontinent
== formation ==
reconstructions of rodinia varies but most include five elements:
laurentia or the canadian shield is located at the centre;
the west coast of laurentia is facing antarctica and australia (or east gondwana);
the east coast of laurentia is facing the amazonian craton;
the north coast is facing baltica;
and siberia lies next to baltica
less certain position of continental blocks includes:
the west african craton was simply an extension of the amazonian craton;
east gondwana was probably broken apart by oceans;
the cathaysian terranes (indochina north china and south china) were located adjacent to east gondwana near the north pole;
the congo craton was located on the south coast of laurentia probably separated from rodinia by the mozambique and adamastor oceans
the formation of pannotia began during the pan-african orogeny when the congo continent got caught between the northern and southern halves of the previous supercontinent rodinia some 750 ma the peak in this mountain building event was around 640610 ma but these continental collisions may have continued into the early cambrian some 530 ma the formation of pannotia was the result of rodinia turning itself inside out
when pannotia had formed africa was located at the centre surrounded by the rest of gondwana: south america arabia madagascar india antarctica and australia laurentia who 'escaped' out of rodinia baltica and siberia kept the relative positions they had in rodinia the cathaysian and cimmerian terranes (continental blocks of southern asia) were located along the northern margins of east gondwana the avalonian-cadomian terranes (later to become central europe britain the north american east coast and yucatn) were located along the active northern margins of western gondwana this orogeny probably extended north into the uralian margin of baltica
pannotia formed by subduction of exterior oceans (a mechanism called extroversion) over a geoid low whereas pangaea formed by subduction of interior oceans (introversion) over a geoid high perhaps caused by superplumes and slab avalanche events the oceanic crust subducted by pannotia formed within the mirovoi superocean that surrounded rodinia before its 830-750 ma break-up and were accreted during the late proterozoic orogenies that resulted from the assembly of pannotia
one of the major of these orogenies was the collision between east and west gondwana or the east african orogeny the trans-saharan belt in west africa is the result of the collision between the east saharan shield and the west african craton when 1200-710 ma-old volcanic and arc-related rocks were accreted to the margin of this craton 600-500 ma two brazilian interior orogenies got highly deformed and metamorphosed between a series of colliding cratons: amazonia west africa-so lus and so francisco-congo-kasai the material that was accreted included 950-850 ma mafic meta-igneous complexes and younger arc-related rocks
== break-up ==
the break-up of pannotia was accompanied by sea level rise dramatic changes in climate and ocean water chemistry and rapid metazoan diversification
bond nickeson & kominz 1984 found neoproterozoic passive margin sequences worldwide the first indication of a late neoproterozoic supercontinent but also the traces of its demise
the iapetus ocean started to open while pannotia was being assembled 200 m.y after the break-up of rodinia this opening of the iapetus and other cambrian seas coincided with the first steps in the evolution of soft-bodied metazoans and also made a myriad of habitats available for them which led to the so-called cambrian explosion the rapid evolution of skeletalized metazoans
trilobites originated in the neoproterozoic and began to diversify before the break-up of pannotia 600550 ma as evidenced by their ubiquitous presence in the fossil record and the lack of vicariance patterns in their lineage
