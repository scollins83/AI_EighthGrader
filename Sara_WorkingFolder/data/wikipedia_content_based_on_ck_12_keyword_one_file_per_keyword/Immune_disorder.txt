an immune disorder is a dysfunction of the immune system these disorders can be characterized in several different ways:
by the component(s) of the immune system affected
by whether the immune system is overactive or underactive
by whether the condition is congenital or acquired
according to the international union of immunological societies more than 150 primary immunodeficiency diseases (pids) have been characterized however the number of acquired immunodeficiencies exceeds the number of pids
it has been suggested that most people have at least one primary immunodeficiency due to redundancies in the immune system though many of these are never detected
== list of some autoimmune disorders ==
lupus
scleroderma
certain types of hemolytic anemia
vasculitis
type one diabetes
graves disease
rheumatoid arthritis
multiple sclerosis (although it is thought to be an immune-mediated process)
goodpasture's syndrome
pernicious anemia
some types of myopathy
lyme disease (late)
== immunodeficiencies ==
primary immune deficiency diseases are those caused by inherited genetic mutations secondary or acquired immune deficiencies are caused by something outside the body such as a virus or immune suppressing drugs
primary immune diseases are at risk to an increased susceptibility to and often recurrent ear infections pneumonia bronchitis sinusitis or skin infections immunodeficient patients may less frequently develop abscesses of their internal organs autoimmune or rheumatologic and gastrointestinal problems
primary immune deficiencies
severe combined immunodeficiency (scid)
digeorge syndrome
hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome (also known as jobs syndrome)
common variable immunodeficiency (cvid): b-cell levels are normal in circulation but with decreased production of igg throughout the years so it is the only primary immune disorder that presents onset in the late teens years
chronic granulomatous disease (cgd): a deficiency in nadph oxidase enzyme which causes failure to generate oxygen radicals classical recurrent infection from catalase positive bacteria and fungi
wiskott-aldrich syndrome (was)
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (alps)
hyper igm syndrome: x-linked disorder that causes a deficiency in the production of cd40 ligand on activated t-cells this increases the production and release of igm into circulation the b-cell and t-cell numbers are within normal limits increased susceptibility to extracellular bacteria and opportunistic infections
leukocyte adhesion deficiency (lad)
nf-b essential modifier (nemo) mutations
selective immunoglobulin a deficiency: the most common defect of the humoral immunity characterized by a deficiency of iga produces repeating sino-pulmonary and gastrointestinal infections
x-linked agammaglobulinemia (xla; also known as bruton type agammaglobulinemia): characterized by a deficiency in tyrosine kinase enzyme that blocks b-cell maturation in the bone marrow no b-cells are produced to circulation and thus there are no immunoglobulin classes although there tends to be a normal cell-mediated immunity
x-linked lymphoproliferative disease (xlp)
ataxia-telangiectasia
secondary immune deficiencies
aids
== allergies ==
an allergy is an abnormal immune reaction to a harmless antigen
seasonal allergy
mastocytosis
perennial allergy
anaphylaxis
food allergy
allergic rhinitis
atopic dermatitis
