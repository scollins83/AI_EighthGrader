sustainable development (sd) is a process for meeting human development goals while maintaining the ability of natural systems to continue to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend while the modern concept of sustainable development is derived most strongly from the 1987 brundtland report it is rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns
sustainable development is the organizing principle for sustaining finite resources necessary to provide for the needs of future generations of life on the planet it is a process that envisions a desirable future state for human societies in which living conditions and resource-use continue to meet human needs without undermining the "integrity stability and beauty" of natural biotic systems
== definitionedit ==
sustainability can be defined as the practice of reserving resources for future generation without any harm to the nature and other components of it  sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social political and economic challenges faced by humanity sustainability science is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science there is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations
== dimensionsedit ==
sustainable development has been described in terms of three dimensions domains or pillars in the three-dimension model these are seen as "economic environmental and social" or "ecology economy and equity"; this has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture institutions or governance
=== ecologyedit ===
the ecological sustainability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural social and built environments also termed human ecology this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air water food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development; addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which in this sense extends to all species
==== environmentedit ====
environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive since natural resources are derived from the environment the state of air water and the climate are of particular concern the ipcc fifth assessment report outlines current knowledge about scientific technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change and lists options for adaptation and mitigation environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet this for example entails using water sustainably utilizing renewable energy and sustainable material supplies (e.g harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity)
an unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity theoretically the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support if the degradation continues beyond a certain tipping point or critical threshold it would lead to eventual extinction for humanity
integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities a telling example is the european environmental research and innovation policy which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development research and innovation in europe is financially supported by the programme horizon 2020 which is also open to participation worldwide a promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible
==== agricultureedit ====
sustainable agriculture consists of environmentally-friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems it involves preventing adverse effects to soil water biodiversity surrounding or downstream resourcesas well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas the concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally passing on a conserved or improved natural resource biotic and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted elements of sustainable agriculture include permaculture agroforestry mixed farming multiple cropping and crop rotation
numerous sustainability standards and certification systems have been established in recent years offering consumer choices for sustainable agriculture practices these include organic certification rainforest alliance fair trade utz certified bird friendly and the common code for the coffee community (4c)
==== energyedit ====
sustainable energy is clean and lasts for a long period of time unlike the fossil fuel that most of the countries are using renewable energy only produces little or even no pollution the most common types of renewable energy in us are solar and wind energy; solar energy are commonly used on public parking meter street lights and the roof of buildings wind power has expanded quickly generating 12,000 mw in 2013 most of californias fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities and have traditionally suffered the most from californias fossil fuel energy system these communities are historically left out during the decision-making process and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area these toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities as renewable energy becomes more common fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables providing better social equity to these communities overall and in the long run sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies
==== transportationedit ====
transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions it is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation some western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations an example is the modifications in available transportation in freiburg germany the city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation cycling and walking along with large areas where cars are not allowed
since many western countries are highly automobile-orientated areas the main transit that people use is personal vehicles about 80% of their travel involves cars therefore california deep in the automobile-oriented west is one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the country the federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission such as:
improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network
encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway bike share station in commercial downtown locate parking lot far from the shopping center limit on street parking slower traffic lane in downtown area
increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles they can produce social equity problem since lower people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve the public transportation and benefit the poor community
other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence-based sustainable transportation policies
=== economicsedit ===
it has been suggested that because of rural poverty and overexploitation environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets called natural capital economic development has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product this model of unlimited personal and gdp growth may be over sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption according to ecological economist malte faber ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature justice and time issues of intergenerational equity irreversibility of environmental change uncertainty of long-term outcomes and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation
as early as the 1970s the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems." scientists in many fields have highlighted the limits to growth and economists have presented alternatives for example a 'steady state economy'; to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet in 1987 the economist edward barbier published the study the concept of sustainable economic development where he recognized that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other
a world bank study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability in macroeconomics or purely environmental a study from 2001 noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state the study interpreting sustainability in economic terms found three pillars of sustainable development interlinkage intergenerational equity and dynamic efficiency
a meta review in 2002 looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of sustainability policies a study in 2004 asked if we consume too much a study concluded in 2007 that knowledge manufactured and human capital(health and education) has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world it has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics a meta review in 2009 identified conditions for a strong case to act on climate change and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare according to john baden the improvement of environment quality depends on the market economy and the existence of legitimate and protected property rights they enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment the state can in this context create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment
==== businessedit ====
the most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firms efficient use of natural capital this eco-efficiency is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact this idea has been popularised by the world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd) under the following definition: "eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earths carrying capacity." (desimone and popoff 1997: 47)
similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability socio-efficiency describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact whereas it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts these can be either positive (e.g corporate giving creation of employment) or negative (e.g work accidents mobbing of employees human rights abuses) depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimize negative social impacts (i.e accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e donations per value added) in relation to the value added
both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability in this process they instrumentalize both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations however as dyllick and hockerts point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development they point towards eco-effectiveness socio-effectiveness sufficiency and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached
==== incomeedit ====
at the present time sustainable development as well as solidarity or catholic social teaching can impact reduce the poverty because over many thousands of years the stronger (economically or physically) used to defeat/eliminate the weaker nowadays no matter what we call the reason for this decision within catholic social teaching social solidarity and sustainable development the stronger helps the weaker this aid may take the form of in-kind or material refer to the present or the future the stronger should offer real help and not as demonstrated by the frequent experience strive for the elimination or annihilation of another entity sustainable development reduce poverty through economic (among other things a balanced budget) environmental (living conditions) and also social (including equality of income) dimensions
==== architectureedit ====
in sustainable architecture the recent movements of new urbanism and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design this in contrast to modernist and international style architecture as well as opposing to solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints both trends started in the 1980s (it should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.)
=== politicsedit ===
a study concluded that social indicators and therefore sustainable development indicators are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making the international institute for sustainable development has similarly developed a political policy framework linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics the framework consists of six core areas international trade and investment economic policy climate change and energy measurement and assessment natural resource management and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development
the united nations global compact cities programme has defined sustainable political development is a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance the political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation authorisation legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common this definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic ecological and cultural challenges it also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed they have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:
organization and governance
law and justice
communication and critique
representation and negotiation
security and accord
dialogue and reconciliation
ethics and accountability
this accords with the brundtland commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above)
=== cultureedit ===
working with a different emphasis some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society in this context the agenda 21 for culture and the united cities and local governments (uclg) executive bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement culture: fourth pillar of sustainable development passed on 17 november 2010 in the framework of the world summit of local and regional leaders 3rd world congress of uclg held in mexico city although some which still argue that economics is primary and culture and politics should be included in 'the social' this document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies the circles of sustainability approach distinguishes the four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability
other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development the network of excellence "sustainable development in a diverse world" sponsored by the european union integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development the fourth pillar of sustainable development theory has been referenced by executive director of imi institute at unesco vito di bari in his manifesto of art and architectural movement neo-futurism whose name was inspired by the 1987 united nations report our common future the circles of sustainability approach used by metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices discourses and material expressions which over time express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning
== themesedit ==
=== progressedit ===
the united nations conference on sustainable development (uncsd) also known as rio 2012 rio+20 or earth summit 2012 was the third international conference on sustainable development which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community an outcome of this conference was the development of the sustainable development goals that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world however few nations met the world wide fund for nature's definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006 although some nations are more developed than others all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms
=== measurementedit ===
in 2007 a report for the u.s environmental protection agency stated: while much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable at best they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction or that our current activities are not sustainable more often they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them nevertheless a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error)
the most common critiques are related to issues like data quality comparability objective function and the necessary resources however a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: how can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project
the cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur sonia bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project activity or enterprise furthermore this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources
reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen u.s green building councils (usgbc) leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) this design incorporates some ecological economic and social elements the goals presented by leed design goals are sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmospheric emission reduction material and resources efficiency and indoor environmental quality although amount of structures for sustainability development is many these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building
recent research efforts created also the sdewes index to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy water and environment systems the sdewes index consists of 7 dimensions 35 indicators and close to 20 sub-indicators it is currently applied to 58 cities
=== natural capitaledit ===
the sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic social and natural) which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible daly (1991) for example points to the fact that natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital while it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services such as the protection provided by the ozone layer or the climate stabilizing function of the amazonian forest in fact natural capital social capital and economic capital are often complementarities a further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources forests for example not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily) but they also maintain biodiversity regulate water flow and absorb co2
another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility the loss in biodiversity for example is often definite the same can be true for cultural diversity for example with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates moreover the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached a lake can for example absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity however once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lakes ecosystem to break down suddenly
=== business-as-usualedit ===
if the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it cohen and winn point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: first while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatized the costs are often externalized (i.e they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general) second natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital information asymmetry is a third reasonoften the link between cause and effect is obscured making it difficult for actors to make informed choices cohen and winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimizers they postulate that firms often do not optimize resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality
== historical developmentedit ==
sustainable development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in england john evelyn argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay sylva in 1713 hans carl von carlowitz a senior mining administrator in the service of elector frederick augustus i of saxony published sylvicultura oeconomica a 400-page work on forestry building upon the ideas of evelyn and french minister jean-baptiste colbert von carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield his work influenced others including alexander von humboldt and georg ludwig hartig leading in turn to the development of a science of forestry this in term influenced people like gifford pinchot first head of the us forest service whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources and aldo leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s
following the publication of rachel carson's silent spring in 1962 the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation kenneth e boulding in his influential 1966 essay the economics of the coming spaceship earth identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources one of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the club of rome in 1972 in its classic report on the limits to growth written by a group of scientists led by dennis and donella meadows of the massachusetts institute of technology describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium" the authors wrote: "we are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."
in 1980 the international union for the conservation of nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority two years later the united nations world charter for nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged in 1987 the united nations world commission on environment and development released the report our common future commonly called the brundtland report the report included what is now one of the most widely recognized definitions of sustainable development
in 1992 the un conference on environment and development published in 1992 the earth charter which outlines the building of a just sustainable and peaceful global society in the 21st century the action plan agenda 21 for sustainable development identified information integration and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognizes these interdependent pillars it emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information it stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes furthermore agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development under the principles of the united nations charter the millennium declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection broadly defined sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural produced and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations the term sustainable development as used by the united nations incorporates both issues associated with land development and broader issues of human development such as education public health and standard of living
a 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains: ecology economics politics and culture
== criticism of the conceptedit ==
it has been argued that since the 1960s the concept of sustainable development has slided from 'conservation management' to 'economic development' whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat
in the 1960s the international community realised that many african countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil climate and water availability this was a strategy of conservation management in the 70s however the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in africa) this was a strategy of economic development and the strategy was carried even further by the brundtland report when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application in effect the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers
but shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry) to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like minerals) this stretching of the term has been questioned thus environmental economist kerry turner has argued that literally there can be no such thing as overall 'sustainable development' in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources:
