ship transport is watercraft carrying people (passengers) or goods (cargo)
sea transport has been the largest carrier of freight throughout recorded history although the importance of sea travel for passengers has decreased due to aviation it is effective for short trips and pleasure cruises transport by water is cheaper than transport by air despite fluctuating exchange rates and caf charges to account for such
ship transport can be over any distance by boat ship sailboat or barge over oceans and lakes through canals or along rivers shipping may be for commerce recreation or the military purpose virtually any material can be moved by water; however water transport becomes impractical when material delivery is highly time-critical
containerization revolutionized ship transport starting in the 1970s "general cargo" includes goods packaged in boxes cases pallets and barrels when a cargo is carried in more than one mode it is intermodal or co-modal
== merchant shipping ==
a nation's shipping fleet (merchant navy merchant marine merchant fleet) consists of the ships operated by civilian crews to transport passengers or cargo from one place to another professionals are merchant seaman merchant sailor and merchant mariner or simply seaman sailor or mariner the terms "seaman" or "sailor" may refer to a member of a country's navy
according to the 2005 cia world factbook the total number of merchant ships of at least 1,000 gross register tons in the world was 30,936 in 2010 it was 38,988 an increase of 26% statistics for individual countries are available at the list of merchant navy capacity by country
== professional mariners ==
a ship's complement can be divided into four categories: the deck department the engineering department the steward's department and other
=== deck department ===
officer positions in the deck department include but not limited to: master and his chief second and third officers the official classifications for unlicensed members of the deck department are able seaman and ordinary seaman
a common deck crew for a ship includes:
(1) chief officer/chief mate
(1) second officer /second mate
(1) third officer / third mate
(1) boatswain
(2-6) able seamen
(0-2) ordinary seamen
a deck cadet is person who is carrying out mandatory seatime to achieve their officer of the watch certificate their time on board is spent learning the operations and tasks of everyday life on a merchant vessel
=== engineering department ===
a ship's engineering department consists of the members of a ship's crew that operate and maintain the propulsion and other systems on board the vessel marine engineering staff also deal with the "hotel" facilities on board notably the sewage lighting air conditioning and water systems they deal with bulk fuel transfers and require training in firefighting and first aid as well as in dealing with the ship's boats and other nautical tasks- especially with cargo loading/discharging gear and safety systems though the specific cargo discharge function remains the responsibility of deck officers and deck workers on lpg and lng tankers however a cargo engineer works with the deck department during cargo operations as well as being a watchkeeping engineer
a common engineering crew for a ship includes:
(1) chief engineer
(1) second engineer / first assistant engineer
(1) third engineer / second assistant engineer
(1-2) fourth engineer / third assistant engineer
(0-2) fifth engineer / junior engineer
(1-3) oiler (unlicensed qualified rating)
(0-3) greaser/s (unlicensed qualified rating)
(1-5) entry-level rating (such as wiper (occupation) utilityman etc.)
many american ships also carry a qualified member of the engine department other possible positions include motorman machinist electrician refrigeration engineer and tankerman engine cadets are trainee engineers who are completing sea time necessary before they can obtain a watchkeeping license
=== steward's department ===
a typical steward's department for a cargo ship would be composed of a chief steward a chief cook and a steward's assistant all three positions are typically filled by unlicensed personnel
the chief steward directs instructs and assigns personnel performing such functions as preparing and serving meals; cleaning and maintaining officers' quarters and steward department areas; and receiving issuing and inventorying stores
on large passenger vessels the catering department is headed by the chief purser and managed by assistant pursers although they enjoy the benefits of having officer rank they generally progress through the ranks to become pursers under the pursers are the department heads - such as chief cook head waiter head barman etc they are responsible for the administration of their own areas
the chief steward also plans menus; compiles supply overtime and cost control records may requisition or purchase stores and equipment they may bake bread rolls cakes pies and pastries
a chief steward's duties may overlap with those of the steward's assistant the chief cook and other steward's department crewmembers
in the united states merchant marine in order to be occupied as a chief steward a person has to have a merchant mariner's document issued by the united states coast guard because of international conventions and agreements all chief cooks who sail internationally are similarly documented by their respective countries
=== other departments ===
staff officer positions on a ship including junior assistant purser senior assistant purser purser chief purser medical doctor professional nurse marine physician assistant and hospital corpsman are considered administrative positions and are therefore regulated by certificates of registry issued by the united states coast guard pilots are also merchant marine officers and are licensed by the coast guard formerly there was also a radio department headed by a chief radio officer and supported by a number of radio officers since the introduction of gmdss (satellite communications) and the subsequent exemptions from carrying radio officers if the vessel is so equipped this department has fallen away although many ships do still carry specialist radio officers particularly passenger vessels many radio officers became 'electro-technical officers' and transferred into the engineering department
=== life at sea ===
mariners spend much of their life beyond the reach of land they sometime face dangerous conditions at sea yet men and women still go to sea for some the attraction is a life unencumbered with the restraints of life ashore seagoing adventure and a chance to see the world also appeal to many seafarers whatever the calling those who live and work at sea invariably confront social isolation
findings by the seafarer's international research center indicate a leading cause of mariners leaving the industry is "almost invariably because they want to be with their families." u.s merchant ships typically do not allow family members to accompany seafarers on voyages industry experts increasingly recognize isolation stress and fatigue as occupational hazards advocacy groups such as international labour organization a united nations agency and the nautical institute are seeking improved international standards for mariners satellite phones have improved communication and efficiency aboard sea-faring ships this technology has contributed to crew welfare although both equipment and fees are expensive
ocean voyages are steeped in routine maritime tradition dictates that each day be divided into six four-hour periods three groups of watch keepers from the engine and deck departments work four hours on then have eight hours off watch keeping however there are many overtime jobs to be done daily this cycle repeats endlessly 24 hours a day while the ship is at sea members of the steward department typically are day workers who put in at least eight-hour shifts operations at sea including repairs safeguarding against piracy securing cargo underway replenishment and other duties provide opportunities for overtime work service aboard ships typically extends for months at a time followed by protracted shore leave however some seamen secure jobs on ships they like and stay aboard for years
the quick turnaround of many modern ships spending only a few hours in port limits a seafarer's free-time ashore moreover some foreign seamen entering u.s ports from a watch list of 25 countries face restrictions on shore leave due to security concerns however shore leave restrictions while in u.s ports impact american seamen as well for example the international organization of masters mates & pilots notes a trend of u.s shipping terminal operators restricting seamen from traveling from the ship to the terminal gate furthermore in cases where transit is allowed special "security fees" are at times assessed
such restrictions on shore leave coupled with reduced time in port translate into longer periods at sea mariners report that extended periods at sea living and working with shipmates who for the most part are strangers takes getting used to at the same time there is an opportunity to meet people from other ethnic and cultural backgrounds recreational opportunities have improved aboard some u.s ships which may feature gyms and day rooms for watching movies swapping sea stories and other activities and in some cases especially tankers it is possible for a mariner to be accompanied by members of his family however a mariners off-duty time is largely a solitary affair pursuing hobbies reading writing letters and sleeping
on modern ocean-going vessels typically registered with a flag of convenience life has changed immensely in the last 20 years most large vessels include a gym and often a swimming pool for use by the crew since the exxon valdez incident the focus of leisure time activity has shifted from having officer and crew bars to simply having lounge-style areas where officers or crew can sit to watch movies with many companies now providing tvs and dvd players in cabins and enforcing strict smoking policies it is not surprising that the bar is now a much quieter place on most ships in some instances games consoles are provided for the officers and crew the officers enjoy a much higher standard of living on board ocean-going vessels
crews are generally poorly paid poorly qualified and have to complete contracts of approximately 9 months before returning home on leave they often come from countries where the average industrial wage is still very low such as the philippines or india officers however come from all over the world and it is not uncommon to mix the nationality of the officers on board ships officers are often the recipients of university degrees and have completed vast amounts of training in order to reach their rank officers benefit e.g by having larger more comfortable cabins and table service for their meals
contracts average at the 4 month mark for officers with generous leave most ocean-going vessels now operate an unmanned engine room system allowing engineers to work days only the engine room is computer controlled by night although the duty engineer will make inspections during unmanned operation engineers work in a hot humid noisy atmosphere communication in the engine room is therefore by hand signals and lip-reading and good teamwork often stands in place of any communication at all
== ships and watercraft ==
ships and other watercraft are used for ship transport types can be distinguished by propulsion size or cargo type recreational or educational craft still use wind power while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more propellers or in the case of jet boats an inboard water jet in shallow draft areas such as the everglades some craft such as the hovercraft are propelled by large pusher-prop fans
most modern merchant ships can be placed in one of a few categories such as:
ships that fall outside these categories include semi-submersible heavy-lift ships or ohgc
== liners and tramps ==
a ship may also be categorised as to how it is operated
a liner will have a regular run and operate to a schedule the scheduled operation requires that such ships are better equipped to deal with causes of potential delay such as bad weather they are generally higher powered than tramp ships with better seakeeping qualities thus they are significantly more expensive to build liners are typically built for passenger and container operation though past common uses also included mail and general cargo
a tramp has no fixed run but will go wherever a suitable cargo takes it thus a ship and crew may be chartered from the ship owner to fetch a cargo of grain from canada to latvia the ship may then be required to carry a cargo of coal from britain to melanesia bulk carriers and cruise ships are examples of ships built to operate in this manner
== typical in-transit times ==
a cargo ship sailing from a european port to a us one will typically take 1012 days depending on water currents and other factors in order to make container ship transport more economical in the face of declining demand for intercontinental shipping ship operators sometimes reduce cruising speed thereby increasing transit time to reduce fuel consumption a strategy referred to as "slow steaming"
== ship transport infrastructure ==
for a port to efficiently send and receive cargo it requires infrastructure harbors seaports and marinas host watercraft and consist of components such as piers wharfs docks and roadsteads
