monogamy (/mnmi/ m-nog--mee) is a form of relationship in which an individual has only one partner during his or her lifetime or at any one time (serial monogamy) as compared to polygyny polyandry or polyamory the term is also applied to the social behavior of some animals referring to the state of having only one mate at any one time
it is important to have a clear understanding of the nomenclature of monogamy because scientists use the term monogamy for different relationships biologists biological anthropologists and behavioral ecologists often use the term monogamy in the sense of sexual if not genetic monogamy modern biological researchers using the theory of evolution approach human monogamy as the same in human and non-human animal species they postulate the following four aspects of monogamy:
marital monogamy refers to marriages of only two people
social monogamy refers to two partners living together having sex with each other and cooperating in acquiring basic resources such as shelter food and money
sexual monogamy refers to two partners remaining sexually exclusive with each other and having no outside sex partners
genetic monogamy refers to sexually monogamous relationships with genetic evidence of paternity
when cultural or social anthropologists and other social scientists use the term monogamy the meaning is social or marital monogamy marital monogamy may be further distinguished between:
marriage once in a lifetime;
marriage with only one person at a time (serial monogamy) in contrast to bigamy or polygamy;
human monogamy's legal aspects are taught at faculties of law there are also philosophical aspects in the field of interest of e.g philosophical anthropology and philosophy of religion as well as theological ones
== etymologyedit ==
the word monogamy comes from the greek  monos which means one or alone and  gamos which means marriage
== frequency of monogamy in humansedit ==
=== distribution of social monogamyedit ===
according to the ethnographic atlas of 1,231 societies from around the world noted 186 were monogamous; 453 had occasional polygyny; 588 had more frequent polygyny; and 4 had polyandry however this does not take into account the relative population of each of the societies studied and the actual practice of polygamy in a tolerant society may actually be low with the majority of aspirant polygamists practicing monogamous marriage
many societies that we consider monogamous in fact allow easy divorce in many western countries divorce rates approach 50% those who remarry do so on average 3 times divorce and remarriage can thus result in "serial monogamy" i.e multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time this can be interpreted as a form of plural mating as are those societies dominated by female-headed families in the caribbean mauritius and brazil where there is frequent rotation of unmarried partners in all these account for 16 to 24% of the "monogamous" category
=== prevalence of sexual monogamyedit ===
the prevalence of sexual monogamy can be roughly estimated as the percentage of married people who do not engage in extramarital sex the standard cross-cultural sample describes the amount of extramarital sex by men and women in over 50 pre-industrial cultures the amount of extramarital sex by men is described as "universal" in 6 cultures "moderate" in 29 cultures "occasional" in 6 cultures and "uncommon" in 10 cultures the amount of extramarital sex by women is described as "universal" in 6 cultures "moderate" in 23 cultures "occasional" in 9 cultures and "uncommon" in 15 cultures these findings support the claim that the amount of extramarital sex differs across cultures and across genders
recent surveys conducted in non-western nations have also found cultural and gender differences in extramarital sex a study of sexual behavior in thailand tanzania and cte d'ivoire suggests about 1634% of men engage in extramarital sex while a much smaller (unreported) percentage of women engage in extramarital sex studies in nigeria have found around 4753% of men and to 1836% of women engage in extramarital sex a 1999 survey of married and cohabiting couples in zimbabwe reports that 38% of men and 13% of women engaged in extra-couple sexual relationships within the last 12 months
the issue of extramarital sex has been examined frequently in the united states many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the united states have relied on convenience samples a convenience sample means surveys are given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g. volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers) convenience samples do not accurately reflect the population of the united states as a whole which can cause serious biases in survey results it should not be surprising therefore that surveys of extramarital sex in the united states have produced widely differing results these studies report that about 1226% of married women and 1543% of married men engage in extramarital sex the only way to get scientifically reliable estimates of extramarital sex is to use nationally representative samples three studies have used nationally representative samples these studies have found that about 1015% of women and 2025% of men engage in extramarital sex
research by colleen hoffon of 566 homosexual male couples from the san francisco bay area found that 45% had monogamous relationships that study was funded by the national institute of mental health however the human rights campaign has stated based on a rockway institute report that "glbt young people want to spend their adult life in a long-term relationship raising children." specifically over 80% of the homosexuals surveyed expected to be in a monogamous relationship after age 30
a majority of married people remain sexually monogamous during their marriages the number of married partners who engage in extramarital sex never exceeds 50% in studies using large or nationally representative samples yet the incidence of sexual monogamy varies across cultures people in some cultures are more sexually monogamous than people in other cultures
=== prevalence of genetic monogamyedit ===
the incidence of genetic monogamy may be estimated from rates of extrapair paternity extrapair paternity is when offspring raised by a monogamous pair come from the female mating with another male rates of extrapair paternity have not been extensively studied in people many reports of extrapair paternity are little more than quotes based on hearsay anecdotes and unpublished findings simmons firman rhodes and peters reviewed 11 published studies of extra-pair paternity from various locations in the united states france switzerland the united kingdom mexico and among the yanomamo indians of south america the rates of extrapair paternity ranged from 0.03% to 11.8% although most of the locations had low percentages of extrapair paternity the median rate of extrapair paternity was 1.8% a separate review of 17 studies by bellis hughes hughes and ashton found slightly higher rates of extrapair paternity the rates varied from 0.8% to 30% in these studies with a median rate of 3.7% extrapair paternity a range of 1.8% to 3.7% extrapair paternity implies a range of 96% to 98% genetic monogamy although the incidence of genetic monogamy may vary from 70% to 99% in different cultures or social environments a large percentage of couples remain genetically monogamous during their relationships a review paper surveying 67 other studies of nonpaternity reporting rates of nonpaternity in different societies ranging from 0.4% to over 50% was recently published by kermyt g anderson
pedigree errors are a well-known source of error in medical studies when attempts are made to try to study medical afflictions and their genetic components it becomes very important to understand nonpaternity rates and pedigree errors there are numerous software packages and procedures that exist for correcting research data for pedigree errors
== the evolutionary and historical development of monogamy in humanity: nature vs nurtureedit ==
=== biological argumentsedit ===
monogamy or at least social monogamy does exist in many societies around the world and it is important to understand how these marriage systems might have evolved in any species there are three main aspects that combine to promote a monogamous mating system: paternal care resource access and mate-choice; however in humans the main theoretical sources of monogamy are paternal care and extreme ecological stresses paternal care should be particularly important in humans due to the extra nutritional requirement of having larger brains and the lengthier developmental period therefore the evolution of monogamy could be a reflection of this increased need for bi-parental care similarly monogamy should evolve in areas of ecological stress because male reproductive success should be higher if their resources are focused on ensuring offspring survival rather than searching for other mates however the evidence does not support these claims due to the extreme sociality and increased intelligence of humans h sapiens have solved many problems that generally lead to monogamy such as those mentioned above for example monogamy is certainly correlated with paternal care as shown by marlowe but not caused by it because humans diminish the need for bi-parental care through the aid of siblings and other family members in rearing the offspring furthermore human intelligence and material culture allows for better adaptation to different and rougher ecological areas thus reducing the causation and even correlation of monogamous marriage and extreme climates
paleoanthropology and genetic studies offer two perspectives on when monogamy evolved in the human species: paleoanthropologists offer tentative evidence that monogamy may have evolved very early in human history whereas genetic studies show that monogamy evolved much more recently less than 10 to 20,000 years ago
paleoanthropological estimates of the time frame for the evolution of monogamy are primarily based on the level of sexual dimorphism seen in the fossil record because in general the reduced male-male competition seen in monogamous mating results in reduced sexual dimorphism according to reno et al. the sexual dimorphism of australopithecus afarensis a human ancestor from approximately 3.93.0 million years ago was within the modern human range based on dental and postcranial morphology although careful not to say that this indicates monogamous mating in early hominids the authors do say that reduced levels of sexual dimorphism in a afarensis do not imply that monogamy is any less probable than polygyny however gordon green and richmond claim that in examining postcranial remains a afarensis is more sexually dimorphic than modern humans and chimps with levels closer to those of orangutans and gorillas furthermore homo habilis living approximately 2.3 mya is the most sexually dimorphic early hominid plavcan and van schaik conclude their examination of this controversy by stating that overall sexual dimorphism in australopithecines is not indicative of any behavioral implications or mating systems
the genetic evidence for the evolution of monogamy in humans is more complex but much easier to interpret while female effective population size (the number of individuals successfully producing offspring thus contributing to the gene pool) as indicated by mitochondrial-dna evidence increased around the time of human (not hominid) expansion out of africa about 80,000100,000 years ago male effective population size as indicated by y-chromosome evidence did not increase until the advent of agriculture 18,000 years ago this means that before 18,000 years ago many females would be reproducing with the same few males
=== cultural argumentsedit ===
despite the human ability to avoid sexual and genetic monogamy social monogamy still forms under many different conditions but most of those conditions are consequences of cultural processes these cultural processes may have nothing to do with relative reproductive success for example anthropologist jack goody's comparative study utilizing the ethnographic atlas demonstrated that monogamy is part of a cultural complex found in the broad swath of eurasian societies from japan to ireland that practice social monogamy sexual monogamy and dowry (i.e "diverging devolution" that allow property to be inherited by children of both sexes) goody demonstrates a statistical correlation between this cultural complex and the development of intensive plough agriculture in those areas drawing on the work of ester boserup goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies in intensive plough agriculture and extensive shifting horticulture in plough agriculture farming is largely men's work and is associated with private property; marriage tends to be monogamous to keep the property within the nuclear family close family (endogamy) are the preferred marriage partners to keep property within the group a molecular genetic study of global human genetic diversity argued that sexual polygyny was typical of human reproductive patterns until the shift to sedentary farming communities approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years ago in europe and asia and more recently in africa and the americas a further study drawing on the ethnographic atlas showed a statistical correlation between increasing size of the society the belief in "high gods" to support human morality and monogamy a survey of other cross-cultural samples has confirmed that the absence of the plough was the only predictor of polygamy although other factors such as high male mortality in warfare (in non-state societies) and pathogen stress (in state societies) had some impact
betzig postulated that culture/society can also be a source of social monogamy by enforcing it through rules and laws set by third-party actors usually in order to protect the wealth or power of the elite for example augustus caesar encouraged marriage and reproduction to force the aristocracy to divide their wealth and power among multiple heirs but the aristocrats kept their socially monogamous legitimate children to a minimum to ensure their legacy while having many extra-pair copulations similarlyaccording to betzigthe christian church enforced monogamy because wealth passed to the closest living legitimate male relative often resulting in the wealthy oldest brother being without a male heir thus the wealth and power of the family would pass to the celibate younger brother of the church in both of these instances the rule-making elite used cultural processes to ensure greater reproductive fitness for themselves and their offspring leading to a larger genetic influence in future generations furthermore the laws of the christian church in particular were important in the evolution of social monogamy in humans they allowed even encouraged poor men to marry and produce offspring which reduced the gap in reproductive success between the rich and poor thus resulting in the quick spread of monogamous marriage systems in the western world according to b s low culture would appear to have a much larger impact on monogamy in humans than the biological forces that are important for non-human animals
other theorists use cultural factors influencing reproductive success to explain monogamy during times of major economic / demographic transitions investing more in a fewer offspring (social monogamy not polygyny) increases reproductive success by ensuring the offspring themselves have enough initial wealth to be successful this is seen in both england and sweden during the industrial revolution and is currently being seen in the modernization of rural ethiopia similarly in modern industrialized societies fewer yet better-invested offspring i.e social monogamy can provide a reproductive advantage over social polygyny but this still allows for serial monogamy and extra-pair copulations
=== arguments from outside the scientific communityedit ===
karol wojtya (later pope john paul ii) in his book love and responsibility postulated that monogamy as an institutional union of two people being in love with one another was an embodiment of an ethical personalistic norm and thus the only means of making true human love possible
=== monogamy in ancient societiesedit ===
the historical record offers contradictory evidence on the development and extent of monogamy as a social practice laura betzig argues that in the six large highly stratified early states commoners were generally monogamous but that elites practiced de facto polygyny those states included mesopotamia egypt aztec mexico inca peru india and china
==== ancient mesopotamia and assyriaedit ====
both the babylonian and assyrian families were monogamous in principle but not entirely so in practice since polygyny was frequently practiced by the rulers
in the patriarchal society of mesopotamia the nuclear family was called a "house" in order "to build a house" a man was supposed to marry one woman and if she did not provide him with offspring he could take a second wife the code of hammurabi states that he loses his right to do so if the wife herself gives him a slave as concubine according to old assyrian texts he could be obliged to wait for two or three years before he was allowed to take another wife the position of the second wife was that of a "slave girl" in respect to the first wife as many marriage contracts explicitly state
==== ancient egyptedit ====
although an egyptian man was free to marry several women at a time and some wealthy men from old and middle kingdoms did have more than one wife monogamy was the norm there may have been some exceptions e.g a nineteenth dynasty official stated as proof of his love to his deceased wife that he had stayed married to her since their youth even after he had become very successful (p leiden i 371) this may suggest that some men abandoned first wives of a low social status and married women of higher status in order to further their careers although even then they lived with only one wife egyptian women had right to ask for a divorce if her husband took a second wife many tomb reliefs testify to monogamous character of egyptian marriages officials are usually accompanied by a supportive wife "his wife x his beloved" is the standard phrase identifying wives in tomb inscriptions the instruction texts belonging to wisdom literature e.g instruction of ptahhotep or instruction of any support fidelity to monogamous marriage life calling the wife a lady of the house the instruction of ankhsheshonq suggests that it is wrong to abandon a wife because of her barrenness
==== ancient israeledit ====
as against betzig's contention that monogamy evolved as a result of christian socio-economic influence in the west monogamy appeared widespread in the ancient middle east much earlier in israel's pre-christian era an essentially monogamous ethos underlay the jewish creation story (gn 2) and the last chapter of proverbs during the second temple period (530 bce to70 ce) apart from an economic situation which supported monogamy even more than in earlier period the concept of "mutual fidelity" between husband and wife was a quite common reason for strictly monogamous marriages some marriage documents explicitly expressed a desire for the marriage to remain monogamous examples of these documents were found in elephantine they resemble those found in neighbouring assyria and babylonia study shows that ancient middle east societies though not strictly monogamous were practically (at least on commoners' level) monogamous halakha of the dead sea sect saw prohibition of polygamy as coming from the pentateuch (damascus document 4:205:5 one of the dead sea scrolls) christianity adopted a similar attitude (cf 1 tm 3:2,12; tt 1:6) which conformed with jesus' approach
under judges and the monarchy old restrictions went into disuse especially among royalty though the books of samuel and kings which cover entire period of monarchy do not record a single case of bigamy among commoners except for samuel's father the wisdom books e.g book of wisdom which provides a picture of the society sirach proverbs qohelet portray a woman in a strictly monogamous family (cf pr 5:15-19; qo 9:9; si 26:1-4 and eulogy of perfect wife proverbs 31:10-31) the book of tobias speaks solely of monogamous marriages also prophets have in front of their eyes monogamous marriage as an image of the relationship of god and israel (cf ho 2:4f; jer 2:2; is 50:1; 54:6-7; 62:4-5; ez 16) roland de vaux states that "it is clear that the most common form of marriage in israel was monogamy"
the mishnah and the baraitot clearly reflect a monogamist viewpoint within judaism (yevamot 2:10 etc.) some sages condemned marriage to two wives even for the purpose of procreation (ketubot 62b) r ammi an amora states:
whoever takes a second wife in addition to his first one shall divorce the first and pay her kettubah (yevamot 65a)
roman customs which prohibited polygamy may have enhanced such an attitude - especially after 212 ad when all the jews became roman citizens however some jews continued to practice bigamy (e.g up to medieval times in egypt and europe) fourth-century roman law forbade jews to contract plural marriages
a synod convened by gershom ben judah around 1000 ce banned polygamy among ashkenazi and sephardic jews
==== ancient greece and ancient romeedit ====
the ancient greeks and romans were monogamous in the sense that men were not allowed to have more than one wife or to cohabit with concubines during marriage
==== early christianityedit ====
jesus christ contended that core problem was faithfulness to the torah according to him monogamy was a primordial will of the creator described in genesis darkened by the hardness of hearts of the israelites as john paul ii interpreted the dialogue between jesus and the pharisees (gospel of matthew 19:38) christ emphasized the primordial beauty of monogamic spousal love described in the book of genesis 1:2631 2:425 whereby a man and woman by their nature are each ready to be a beautifying total and personal gift to one another:
jesus avoids entangling himself in juridical or casuistic controversies; instead he appeals twice to the "beginning" by doing so he clearly refers to the relevant words of genesis which his interlocutors also know by heart (...) it clearly leads the interlocutors to reflect about the way in which in the mystery of creation man was formed precisely as "male and female," in order to understand correctly the normative meaning of the words of genesis
== varieties of monogamy in biologyedit ==
recent discoveries have led biologists to talk about the three varieties of monogamy: social monogamy sexual monogamy and genetic monogamy the distinction between these three are important to the modern understanding of monogamy
monogamous pairs of animals are not always sexually exclusive many animals that form pairs to mate and raise offspring regularly engage in sexual activities with partners other than their primary mate this is called extra-pair copulation sometimes these extra-pair sexual activities lead to offspring genetic tests frequently show that some of the offspring raised by a monogamous pair come from the female mating with an extra-pair male partner these discoveries have led biologists to adopt new ways of talking about monogamy:
"social monogamy refers to a male and female's social living arrangement (e.g. shared use of a territory behaviour indicative of a social pair and/or proximity between a male and female) without inferring any sexual interactions or reproductive patterns in humans social monogamy equals monogamous marriage sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions finally the term genetic monogamy is used when dna analyses can confirm that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other a combination of terms indicates examples where levels of relationships coincide e.g. sociosexual and sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social and sexual and social and genetic monogamous relationships respectively." (reichard 2003 page 4)
whatever makes a pair of animals socially monogamous does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous social monogamy sexual monogamy and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations
social monogamy does not always involve marriage in humans a married couple is almost always a socially monogamous couple but couples who choose to cohabit without getting married can also be socially monogamous the popular science author matt ridley in his book the red queen: sex and the evolution of human nature described the human mating system as "monogamy plagued by adultery"
=== serial monogamyedit ===
serial monogamy is a mating practice in which individuals may engage in sequential monogamous pairings or in terms of humans when men or women can marry another partner but only after ceasing to be married to the previous partner
one theory is that this pattern pacifies the elite men and equalizes reproductive success this is called the male compromise theory such serial monogamy may effectively resemble polygyny in its reproductive consequences because some men are able to utilize more than one womans reproductive lifespan through repeated marriages
serial monogamy may also refer to sequential sexual relationships irrespective of marital status a pair of humans may remain sexually exclusive or monogamous until the relationship has ended and then each may go on to form a new exclusive pairing with a different partner this pattern of serial monogamy is common among people in western cultures
==== reproductive successedit ====
evolutionary theory predicts that males would be apt to seek more mating partners than females because they obtain higher reproductive benefits from such a strategy accordingly males developed many behavior strategies that allow them to acquire more reproductively capable sexual partners therefore in order to monopolize periods of more than one females reproductive life span without being considered polygamous and thus breaking social norms of a monogamous society males try to remarry women younger than themselves a study done in 1994 found a significant difference between ages of remarried men and women because the men have a longer reproductive window
==== breakupedit ====
serial monogamy has always been closely linked to divorce practices whenever procedures for obtaining divorce have been simple and easy serial monogamy has been found as divorce has continued to become more accessible more individuals have availed themselves of it and many go on to remarry barry schwartz author of the paradox of choice: why less is more further suggests that western culture's inundation of choice has devalued relationships based on lifetime commitments and singularity of choice it has been suggested however that high mortality rates in centuries past accomplished much the same result as divorce enabling remarriage (of one spouse) and thus serial monogamy
=== mating systemedit ===
monogamy is one of several mating systems observed in animals however a pair of animals may be socially monogamous but that does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous social monogamy sexual monogamy and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations
social monogamy refers to the overtly observed living arrangement whereby a male and female share territory and engage in behaviour indicative of a social pair but does not imply any particular sexual fidelity or reproductive pattern the extent to which social monogamy is observed in animals varies across taxa with over 90 percent of avian species being socially monogamous compared to only 3 percent of mammalian species and up to 15 percent of primate species social monogamy has also been observed in reptiles fish and insects
sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions however scientific analyses can test for paternity for example by dna paternity testing or by fluorescent pigment powder tracing of females to track physical contact this type of analysis can uncover reproductively successful sexual pairings or physical contact genetic monogamy refers to dna analyses confirming that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other
the incidence of sexual monogamy appears quite rare in other parts of the animal kingdom it is becoming clear that even animals that are overtly socially monogamous engage in extra-pair copulations for example while over 90% of birds are socially monogamous "on average 30 percent or more of the baby birds in any nest [are] sired by someone other than the resident male." patricia adair gowaty has estimated that out of 180 different species of socially monogamous songbirds only 10% are sexually monogamous offspring are far more successful when both the male and the female members of the social pair contribute food resources
an example of this was seen when scientists studied red winged blackbirds these birds are known for remaining in monogamous relationships during the course of mating season during the course of the study the researchers gave a few select males vasectomies just before mating season the male birds behaved like they do every season establishing territory finding a mate and attempting to make baby birds despite apparent social monogamy the female birds whose partners were surgically altered still became pregnant indicating that overt social monogamy did not predict for sexual fidelity these babies were cared for by their sterile adoptive fathers
the highest known frequency of reproductively successful extra-pair copulations are found among fairywrens malurus splendens and malurus cyaneus where more than 65 percent of chicks are fathered by males outside the supposed breeding pair this discordantly low level of genetic monogamy has been a surprise to biologists and zoologists as social monogamy can no longer be assumed to determine how genes are distributed in a species
elacatinus also widely known as neon gobies also exhibit social monogamy hetereosexual pairs of fish belonging to the genus elacatinus remain closely associated during both reproductive and non-reproductive periods and often reside in same cleaning station to serve client fish
=== evolution in animalsedit ===
socially monogamous species are scattered throughout the animal kingdom: a few insects a few fish about nine-tenths of birds and a few mammals are socially monogamous there is even a parasitic worm schistosoma mansoni that in its female-male pairings in the human body is monogamous the diversity of species with social monogamy suggests that it is not inherited from a common ancestor but instead evolved independently in many different species
the low occurrence of social monogamy in placental mammals has been claimed to be related to the presence or absence of estrusor oestrusthe duration of sexual receptivity of a female this however doesn't explain why estrus females generally mate with any proximate male nor any correlation between sexual and social monogamy birds which are notable for a high incidence of social monogamy do not have estrus
researchers have observed a mixed mating system of monogamy and polygyny in the european pied flycatcher
=== psychology of monogamyedit ===
psychological studies of social monogamy have relied heavily on observations of married couples these studies focus on relationship satisfaction duration and attachment
