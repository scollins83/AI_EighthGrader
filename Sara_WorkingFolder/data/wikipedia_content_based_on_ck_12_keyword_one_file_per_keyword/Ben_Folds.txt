== early life and careeredit ==
folds was born in winston-salem north carolina he became interested in piano at age nine his father a carpenter brought one home through a barter trade with a customer who was unable to pay during this time folds listened to songs by elton john and billy joel on am radio and learned them by ear during his years at richard j reynolds high school in winston-salem folds played in several bands as the pianist bassist or drummer
in the late 1980s folds (as a bassist) and longtime friend millard powers formed the band majosha the group released several locally produced records they played their first gig at duke university's battle of the bands in 1988 and won they played at bars and fraternity parties and self-produced an ep called party night: five songs about jesus (1988) which they sold locally the ep has four songs none of which are about jesus they recorded shut up and listen to majosha in 1989 it contains among other tracks the four songs from party night (remixed and/or re-recorded) and "emaline" and "video" which folds would later record with his own band the song "get that bug" from party night was released as a dance mix in japan
after majosha broke up folds played drums in a band called pots and pans with evan olson (bass) and britt "snuzz" uzzell (guitar and vocals) but the newly formed band lasted only about a month olson and uzzell formed bus stop with folds' brother chuck folds on bass and eddie walker on drums
folds eventually got a music publishing deal with nashville music executive scott siman who saw folds open for musician marc silvey (as well as playing bass for silvey's band mass confusion) and moved to nashville tennessee to pursue it in 1990 he played drums for a short stint in power bill headed by jody spence millard powers and will owsley power bill was later renamed the semantics folds did not take a creative role in the band he attracted interest from major labels he ended up playing drums there as a session musician
in nashville i was running eight miles a day hanging out with my friends walking around eating chocolate-chip cookies and playing a lot of drums which i enjoyed life was easy i was never frustrated even though i wasn't fulfilling my contract obligations if you are failing in nashville at least your standard of living is nice nashville is a nice way to fail
folds attended the university of miami's frost school of music on a percussion scholarship but dropped out with one credit to go before graduating he devoted a lot of time to working on piano technique "i spent maybe six months just running scales with a metronome like a freak," folds said "i suppose that did something."
folds moved to montclair new jersey and began to act in theater troupes in new york city he enjoyed it in 1993 to the point where he did not want to keep pursuing a musical career he also played weekly gigs at sin- famous for being the cafe which had helped start jeff buckley's career
soon after folds moved back to north carolina the trio of folds bassist robert sledge and drummer darren jessee formed ben folds five in 1994 in chapel hill as folds put it "jeff buckley was being signed at that time by columbia and i was talking to steve his a&r guy and somehow we knew the same people or something."

despite its presence on multiple billboard genre charts no ben folds five singles reached the us hot 100 although they did show well on both adult contemporary and modern rock charts however they gained a strong following in the united kingdom and australia early in their career and like many other 'alternative' american acts this was largely thanks to consistent support from national broadcasters in those countries the bbc in britain and the abc's triple j youth radio network in australia (and abc-tv's music video show rage)
the group's first chart breakthrough came in the uk when "underground" made the lower reaches of the top 40 peaking at no 37 britain was the five's strongest territory in terms of chart success with five singles making the national top 40 there "underground" "battle of who could care less" "kate" "brick" and "army" although none managed to crack the uk top 20
in australia "underground" likewise broke the band locally and while it did not make the aria chart it came in at no 3 the 1998 triple j hottest 100 poll the 1998 single "brick" became the group's only major chart placing in australia reaching no 13; it also came in at no 53 in the aria australian top 100 for that year and earned a gold record award while its parent album whatever and ever amen peaked at no 9 and charted for 32 weeks
