kppen climate classification is one of the most widely used climate classification systems it was first published by russian german climatologist wladimir kppen in 1884 with several later modifications by kppen notably in 1918 and 1936 later german climatologist rudolf geiger collaborated with kppen on changes to the classification system which is thus sometimes called the kppengeiger climate classification system
in the 1960s the trewartha climate classification system was considered a modified kppen system that addressed some of the deficiencies (mostly that the middle latitude climate zone was too broad) of the kppen system
the system is based on the concept that native vegetation is the best expression of climate thus climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind it combines average annual and monthly temperatures and precipitation and the seasonality of precipitation
== scheme ==
the kppen climate classification scheme divides climates into five main groups (a b c d e) each having several types and subtypes each particular climate type is represented by a two- to four-letter symbol
group a: tropical/megathermal climates:
tropical rainforest climate (af)
tropical monsoon climate (am)
tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (aw)
group b: dry (arid and semiarid) climates:
desert climate bw: hot desert (bwh) cold desert (bwk)
steppe climate (semi-arid) bs: hot steppe (bsh) cold steppe (bsk)
group c: temperate/mesothermal climates:
dry-summer or mediterranean climates (csa,csb)
temperate or subtropical hot-summer climates (cwa,cfa)
maritime temperate climates or oceanic climates (cwb cwc,cfb cfc)
maritime subarctic climates or subpolar oceanic climate (cfc)
temperate highland climates with dry winters (cwb cwc)
dry-summer maritime subalpine climate (csc)
group d: continental/microthermal climates
hot summer continental climates (dsa dwa dfa)
warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates (dsb dwb dfb)
continental subarctic or boreal (taiga) climates (dsc dwc dfc)
continental subarctic climates with extremely severe winters (dsd dwd dfd)
group e: polar and alpine climates:
tundra climate (et)
ice cap climate (ef)
=== group a: tropical/megathermal climates ===
tropical climates are characterized by constant high temperatures (at sea level and low elevations); all 12 months of the year have average temperatures of 18 c (64.4 f) or higher they are subdivided as follows:
==== tropical rainforest climate ====
all 12 months have average precipitation of at least 60 mm (2.4 in) these climates usually occur within 510 latitude of the equator in some eastern-coast areas they may extend to as much as 25 away from the equator this climate is dominated by the doldrums low-pressure system all year round so has no natural seasons
examples:
apia samoa
bogor indonesia
davao philippines
innisfail queensland australia
kisangani congo
klang malaysia
kuching malaysia
paramaribo suriname
quibd colombia
ratnapura sri lanka
singapore
west palm beach florida united states
some of the places with this climate are indeed uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year (e.g. the northwest pacific coast of south and central america from ecuador to costa rica; see for instance andagoya colombia) but in many cases the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly wettest (as at palembang indonesia) or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain (as at sitiawan malaysia)
a few places with this climate are found at the outer edge of the tropics almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere; one example is santos so paulo brazil
(note the term aseasonal refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly (or daily) temperature throughout the year annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone albeit unrelated to temperature but to water availability whether as rain mist soil or ground water plant response (e g. phenology) animal (feeding migration reproduction etc.) and human activities (plant sowing harvesting hunting fishing etc.) are tuned to this 'seasonality' indeed in tropical south america and central america the 'rainy season' (and the 'high water season') is called invierno or inverno though it could occur in the northern hemisphere summer; likewise the 'dry season' (and 'low water season') is called verano or vero and can occur in the northern hemisphere winter)
==== tropical monsoon climate ====
this type of climate most common in south america results from the monsoon winds which change direction according to the seasons this climate has a driest month (which nearly always occurs at or soon after the "winter" solstice for that side of the equator) with rainfall less than 60 mm but more than 1/25 the total annual precipitation
examples:
abidjan ivory coast
cairns queensland australia
chittagong bangladesh
guanare portuguesa venezuela
hu tha thinhu vietnam
jakarta indonesia
macap amap brazil
miami florida united states
port harcourt rivers state nigeria
puerto ayacucho amazonas venezuela
sinop mato grosso brazil
yangon myanmar
also another scenario exists under which some places fit into this category; this is referred to as the "trade-wind littoral" climate because easterly winds bring enough precipitation during the "winter" months to prevent the climate from becoming a tropical wet-and-dry climate nassau bahamas is included among these locations
==== tropical wet and dry or savanna climate ====
aw climates have a pronounced dry season with the driest month having precipitation less than 60 mm and less than 1/25 of the total annual precipitation
examples:
barquisimeto venezuela
cartagena colombia
ciudad guayana venezuela
dar es salaam tanzania
darwin northern territory australia
dili east timor
ho chi minh city vietnam
honolulu hawaii united states
jijoca de jericoacora cear brazil
kaohsiung taiwan
kupang indonesia
lagos lagos state nigeria
medelln colombia
mumbai maharashtra india
naples florida united states
port-au-prince haiti
rio de janeiro rio de janeiro brazil
veracruz veracruz mexico
most places that have this climate are found at the outer margins of the tropical zone but occasionally an inner-tropical location (e.g. san marcos antioquia colombia) also qualifies actually the caribbean coast eastward from the gulf of urab on the colombiapanam border to the orinoco river delta on the atlantic ocean (about 4,000 km) have long dry periods (the extreme is the bsh climate (see below) characterised by very low unreliable precipitation present for instance in extensive areas in the guajira and coro western venezuela the northernmost peninsulas in south america which receive <300 mm total annual precipitation practically all in two or three months)
this condition extends to the lesser antilles and greater antilles forming the circum-caribbean dry belt the length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland (southward); at the latitude of the amazon river which flows eastward just south of the equatorial line the climate is af east from the andes between the dry arid caribbean and the ever-wet amazon are the orinoco river's llanos or savannas from where this climate takes its name
sometimes as is used in place of aw if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days this is the case in parts of hawaii northwestern dominican republic (monte cristi villa vsquez lupern) east africa (mombasa kenya) and sri lanka (trincomalee) for instance in most places that have tropical wet and dry climates however the dry season occurs during the time of lower sun and shorter days because of rain shadow effects during the 'high-sun' part of the year
=== group b: dry (arid and semiarid) climates ===
these climates are characterized by actual precipitation less than a threshold value set equal to the potential evapotranspiration the threshold value (in millimeters) is determined as:
multiply the average annual temperature in c by 20 then add (a) 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the high-sun half of the year (april through september in the northern hemisphere or october through march in the southern) or (b) 140 if 30%70% of the total precipitation is received during the applicable period or (c) 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is so received
if the annual precipitation is less than 50% of this threshold the classification is bw (desert climate); if it is in the range of 50%100% of the threshold the classification is bs (steppe climate)
a third letter can be included to indicate temperature originally h signified low-latitude climate (average annual temperature above 18 c) while k signified middle-latitude climate (average annual temperature below 18 c) but the more common practice today especially in the united states is to use h to mean the coldest month has an average temperature above 0 c (32 f) with k denoting that at least one month averages below 0 c
desert areas situated along the west coasts of continents at tropical or near-tropical locations are characterized by cooler temperatures than encountered elsewhere at comparable latitudes (due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents) and frequent fog and low clouds despite the fact that these places rank among the driest on earth in terms of actual precipitation received this climate is sometimes labelled bwn the bsn category can be found in foggy coastal steppes
arid climate examples:
coober pedy australia (bwh)
baghdad iraq (bwh)
upington south africa (bwh)
el paso texas (bwh)
phoenix arizona united states (bwh)
las vegas nevada united states (bwh)
hermosillo sonora mexico (bwh)
almeria spain (bwh)

alexandra new zealand (bsk)
denver colorado united states (bsk)
zacatecas zacatecas mexico (bsk)
tabriz iran (bsk)
lethbridge alberta canada (bsk)
lhasa china (bsk)
on occasion a fourth letter is added to indicate if either the winter or summer is "wetter" than the other half of the year to qualify the wettest month must have at least 60 mm (2.4 in) of average precipitation if all 12 months are above 18 c (64 f) or 30 mm (1.2 in) if not; plus at least 70% of the total precipitation must be in the same half of the year as the wettest month but the letter used indicates when the 'dry' season occurs not the 'wet' one this would result in khartoum sudan being reckoned as bwhw; niamey niger as bshw; alexandria egypt as bwhs; asbi'ah libya as bshs; mngovi province mongolia as bwkw; and xining qinghai china as bskw (bwks and bsks do not exist if 0 c in the coldest month is recognized as the h/k boundary.) if the standards for neither w nor s are met no fourth letter is added
=== group c: temperate/mesothermal climates ===
these climates have an average monthly temperature above 10 c (50 f) in their warmest months (april to september in northern hemisphere) and an average monthly temperature above 3 c (27 f) in their coldest months some climatologists prefer to observe 0 c rather than 3 c in the coldest month as the boundary between this group and the colder group d (continental)
in asia this includes areas from south korea to east- china from beijing southward to northern japan in europe this includes areas from coastal norway south to southern france in the us areas from near 40 latitude in the central and eastern states (a rough line from the nyc/nj/ct area westward to the lower ohio valley lower midwest and southern plains) are located in the kppen c group
the second letter indicates the precipitation pattern w indicates dry winters (driest winter month average precipitation less than one-tenth wettest summer month average precipitation; one variation also requires that the driest winter month have less than 30 mm average precipitation) s indicates dry summers (driest summer month less than 40 mm average precipitation and less than one-third wettest winter month precipitation) and f means significant precipitation in all seasons (neither above-mentioned set of conditions fulfilled)
the third letter indicates the degree of summer heat a indicates warmest month average temperature above 22 c (72 f) with at least four months averaging above 10 c b indicates warmest month averaging below 22 c but with at least four months averaging above 10 c while c means three or fewer months with mean temperatures above 10 c
the order of these two letters is sometimes reversed especially by climatologists in the united states
==== mediterranean climates ====
these climates usually occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30 and 45 these climates are in the polar front region in winter and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable rainy weather summers are hot and dry due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems except in the immediate coastal areas where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain
examples:
beirut lebanon (csa)
latakia syria (csa)
tel aviv israel (csa)
duhok iraq (csa)
los angeles california united states (csa)
sacramento california united states (csa)
walla walla washington united states (csa)

tashkent uzbekistan (csa)
athens greece (csa)
antalya turkey (csa)
dry-summer sometimes extends to additional areas not typically associated with a typical mediterranean climate as their warmest month mean doesn't reach 22 c (71.6 f) they are classified as (csb) some of these areas would border the oceanic climate (cfb) except their dry-summer patterns meet kppen's cs minimum thresholds
examples include
santiago chile (csb)
essaouira morocco (csb)
porto portugal (csb)
san francisco california united states (csb)
portland oregon united states (csb)
cape town south africa (csb)
seattle washington united states (csb)
kingston se australia (csb)
albany western australia australia (csb)
==== humid subtropical climates ====
these climates usually occur on the eastern coasts and eastern sides of continents from 26 to 45 latitude unlike the dry summer mediterranean climates humid subtropical climates have a warm and wet flow from the tropics that creates warm and moist conditions in the summer months as such summer (not winter as is the case in mediterranean climates) is often the wettest season
the flow out of the subtropical highs and the summer monsoon creates a southern flow from the tropics that brings warm and moist air to the lower east sides of continents this flow is often what brings the frequent but short-lived summer thundershowers so typical of the more southerly temperate climates like the southern united states or southern china and japan
examples:
montevideo uruguay (cfa)
buenos aires argentina (cfa)
shanghai china (cfa)
porto alegre brazil (cfa)
brisbane australia (cfa)

==== oceanic climates ====
cfb climates usually occur in the higher middle latitudes on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 40 and 60; they are typically situated immediately poleward of the mediterranean climates although in australia and extreme southern africa this climate is found immediately poleward of temperate climates and at a somewhat lower latitude in western europe this climate occurs in coastal areas up to 63n in norway
these climates are dominated all year round by the polar front leading to changeable often overcast weather summers are cool due to cool ocean currents but winters are milder than other climates in similar latitudes but usually very cloudy cfb climates are also encountered at high elevations in certain subtropical and tropical areas where the climate would be that of a subtropical/tropical rain forest if not for the altitude these climates are called "highlands"
examples:
santander spain (cfb)
artvin turkey (cfb)
auckland new zealand (cfb)
bordeaux france (cfb)
copenhagen denmark (cfb)
bergen norway (cfb)

subpolar oceanic climates (cfc) occur poleward of or at higher elevations than the maritime temperate climates and are mostly confined either to narrow coastal strips on the western poleward margins of the continents or especially in the northern hemisphere to islands off such coasts.examples:
grouse mountain north vancouver british columbia
reykjavk iceland
unalaska alaska united states
trshavn faroe islands
ushuaia argentina (borders on et)
mount read tasmania australia
charlotte pass new south wales australia
auckland islands new zealand
shetland scotland
dry-summer maritime climates (csc) exist in high-elevation areas adjacent to coastal csb climate areas where the strong maritime influence prevent the average winter monthly temperature from dropping below 3 c this climate is extremely rare and is only found in isolated areas of the cascades and andes mountains as the dry-summer climate extends further poleward in the americas than elsewhere.examples:
balmaceda chile
bohemia mountain oregon united states
spirit lake washington (previous to 1980 eruption of mount st helens)
==== highland climate ====
this is a type of climate mainly found in highlands inside the tropics of mexico peru bolivia madagascar zambia zimbabwe and south africa but it is also found in central argentina outside the tropics winters are noticeable and dry and summers can be very rainy in the tropics the rainy season is provoked by the tropical air masses and the dry winters by subtropical high pressure this climate may have characteristics of the oceanic humid subtropical and/or tundra climates
examples:
mexico city (cwb)
bogot colombia (cwb)
juliaca peru (cwb)
johannesburg south africa (cwb)
darjeeling india (cwb)
nairobi kenya (cwb)
copacabana bolivia (cwc)
=== group d: continental/microthermal climates ===
these climates have an average temperature above 10 c (50 f) in their warmest months and a coldest month average below 3 c (or 0 c in some versions as noted previously) these usually occur in the interiors of continents and on their upper east coasts normally north of 40n in the southern hemisphere group d climates are extremely rare due to the smaller land masses in the middle latitudes and the almost complete absence of land at 4060s existing only in some highland locations
group d climates are subdivided as:
lettering
the second letter indicates the precipitation pattern w indicates dry winters (driest winter month average precipitation less than one-tenth wettest summer month average precipitation; one variation also requires that the driest winter month have less than 30 mm average precipitation) s indicates dry summers (driest summer month less than 30 mm average precipitation and less than one-third wettest winter month precipitation) and f means significant precipitation in all seasons (neither above mentioned set of conditions fulfilled)
the third letter indicates the degree of summer heat and (for c and d) winter cold a indicates warmest month average temperature above 22 c (72 f) with at least four months averaging above 10 c b indicates warmest month averaging below 22 c but with at least four months averaging above 10 c c indicates warmest month averaging below 22 c and with three or fewer months with mean temperatures above 10 c but coldest month averaging above 38 c and d indicates warmest month averaging below 22 c three or fewer months averaging above 10 c and coldest month averaging below 38 c
==== hot summer continental climates ====
dfa climates usually occur in the high 40 and low 50 latitudes with a qualifying average temperature in the warmest month of >22 c/72 f in europe these climates tend to be much drier than in north america in eastern asia dwa climates extend further south due to the influence of the siberian high pressure system which also causes winters there to be dry and summers can be very wet because of monsoon circulation dsa exists at higher elevations adjacent to areas with hot summer mediterranean (csa) climates
examples:
chicago illinois united states (dfa)
boston massachusetts united states (dfa)
st louis missouri united states (dfa)
indianapolis indiana united states (dfa)
cleveland ohio united states (dfa)
sioux falls south dakota united states (dfa)

pyongyang north korea (dwa)
seoul south korea (dwa)
beijing china (dwa)
harbin china (dwa)
tianjin china (dwa)
changchun china (dwa)
new york city is on the borderline between this climate and that of the humid subtropical (cfa) climate the line passing through the city
dsa exists only at higher elevations adjacent to areas with hot summer mediterranean (csa) climates
examples include:
sanandaj kordestan iran
arak markazi province iran
saqqez iran
hakkri turkey
mu turkey
salt lake city utah united states
cambridge idaho united states
==== warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates ====
dfb and dwb climates are immediately north of hot summer continental climates generally between 45 and 58 latitude in north america and asia and also in central and eastern europe and russia between the maritime temperate and continental subarctic climates where it extends up to 65 degrees latitude in places
examples:
helsinki finland (dfb)

prague czech republic (dfb)
budapest hungary (dfb)
minsk belarus (dfb)
edmonton alberta canada (dfb)
dickinson north dakota united states (dwb)
vladivostok russia (dwb)
dsb arises from the same scenario as dsa but at even higher altitudes or latitudes and chiefly in north america since the mediterranean climates extend further poleward than in eurasia
examples include:
sivas turkey
yksekova turkey
flagstaff arizona united states
south lake tahoe california united states
bridgeport california united states
spokane washington united states
==== subarctic or boreal climates ====
dfc and dwc climates occur poleward of the other group d climates mostly in the 50 and low 60 north latitude although it might occur as far north as 70n
examples:
murmansk russia (dfc)
yellowknife northwest territories canada (dfc)
whitehorse yukon canada (dfc)
churchill manitoba canada (dfc)
labrador city newfoundland and labrador canada (dfc)
fraser colorado united states (dfc)
fairbanks alaska united states (dfc)
homer alaska united states (dsc)
mohe county heilongjiang china (dwc)
places with this climate have severe winters with the temperature in their coldest month lower than 38 c these climates occur only in eastern siberia the names of some of the places with this climate have become veritable synonyms for extreme severe winter cold
examples:
yakutsk russia (dfd)
verkhoyansk russia (dfd)
seymchan russia (dfd)
oymyakon russia (dwd)
=== group e: polar and alpine climates ===
these climates are characterized by average temperatures below 10 c in all 12 months of the year:
tundra climate (et): warmest month has an average temperature between 0 and 10 c these climates occur on the northern edges of the north american and eurasian land masses and on nearby islands et climates are also found on some islands near the antarctic convergence and at high elevations outside the polar regions above the tree line
examples:
macquarie island (et)
crozet islands (et)
campbell island new zealand (et)
kerguelen islands (et)
stanley falkland islands (et) borders subpolar oceanic (cfc)
la rinconada peru (et)
these climates are a colder and more continental variants of tundra they would have characteristics of the ice cap climate but still manage to see temperatures above 0 c (32 f):
iqaluit nunavut canada (etf)
nanortalik greenland (etf)
mount fuji japan (etf)
mount washington new hampshire (etf)
eureka nunavut canada (etf)
nuuk greenland (etf)
mys shmidta russia (etf)
dikson island russia (etf)
nord greenland greenland (etf)
ice cap climate (ef): this climate is dominant in antarctica and inner greenland but also occurs at extremely high altitudes on mountains above even tundra all twelve months have average temperatures below 0 c (32 f)
examples:
mount rainier washington state (ef)
mount ararat turkey (ef)
dye 3 greenland (ef)
scott base antarctica (ef)
vostok station antarctica (ef) location of the lowest air temperature ever recorded on earth
mcmurdo station antarctica (ef)
byrd station antarctica (ef)
occasionally a third lower-case letter is added to et climates (distinguishing between etf ets and etw) if either the summer or winter is clearly drier than the other half of the year when the option to include this letter is exercised the same standards that are used for groups c and d apply with the additional requirement that the wettest month must have an average of at least 30 mm precipitation (group e climates can be as dry or even drier than group b climates based on actual precipitation received but their rate of evaporation is much lower) seasonal precipitation letters are almost never attached to ef climates mainly due to the difficulty in distinguishing between falling and blowing snow as snow is the sole source of moisture in these climates
== ecological significance ==
the kppen climate classification is based on the empirical relationship between climate and vegetation this classification provides an efficient way to describe climatic conditions defined by temperature and precipitation and their seasonality with a single metric because climatic conditions identified by the kppen classification are ecologically relevant it has been widely used to map geographic distribution of long term climate and associated ecosystem conditions
over the recent years there has been an increasing interest in using the classification to identify changes in climate and potential changes in vegetation over time the most important ecological significance of the kppen climate classification is that it helps to predict the dominant vegetation type based on the climatic data and vice versa
in 2015 a pair of chinese scholars published analysis of climate classifications between 1950 and 2010 finding that more than 5% of all land area worldwide had moved from wetter and colder classifications to drier and hotter classifications
== trewartha climate classification scheme ==
the trewartha climate classification is a climate classification system published by american geographer glenn thomas trewartha in 1966 and updated in 1980 it is a modified version of the 1899 kppen system created to answer some of the deficiencies of the kppen system the trewartha system attempts to redefine the middle latitudes to be closer to vegetation zoning and genetic climate systems it was considered a more true or "real world" reflection of the global climate
for example under the standard kppen system western washington and oregon are classed into the same climate zone as southern california even though the two regions have strikingly different weather and vegetation under the old kppen system cool oceanic climates like that of london were classed in the same zone as hot subtropical cities like savannah ga or brisbane australia in the us locations in the midwest like ohio and iowa which have long severe winter climates where plants are completely dormant were classed into the same climate zone as louisiana or northern florida which have mild winters and a green winter landscape
== other maps ==
all maps use the 0 c definition for temperate climates and the 18 c annual mean temperature threshold to distinguish between hot and cold dry climates
