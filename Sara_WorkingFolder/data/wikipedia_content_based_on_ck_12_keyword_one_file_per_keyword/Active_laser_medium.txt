the active laser medium (also called gain medium or lasing medium) is the source of optical gain within a laser the gain results from the stimulated emission of electronic or molecular transitions to a lower energy state from a higher energy state previously populated by a pump source
examples of active laser media include:
certain crystals typically doped with rare-earth ions (e.g neodymium ytterbium or erbium) or transition metal ions (titanium or chromium); most often yttrium aluminium garnet (y3al5o12) yttrium orthovanadate (yvo4) or sapphire (al2o3);
glasses e.g silicate or phosphate glasses doped with laser-active ions;
gases e.g mixtures of helium and neon (hene) nitrogen argon carbon monoxide carbon dioxide or metal vapors;
semiconductors e.g gallium arsenide (gaas) indium gallium arsenide (ingaas) or gallium nitride (gan)
liquids in the form of dye solutions as used in dye lasers
in order to lase the active gain medium must be in a nonthermal energy distribution known as a population inversion the preparation of this state requires an external energy source and is known as laser pumping pumping may be achieved with electrical currents (e.g semiconductors or gases via high-voltage discharges) or with light generated by discharge lamps or by other lasers (semiconductor lasers) more exotic gain media can be pumped by chemical reactions nuclear fission or with high-energy electron beams
== example of a model of gain medium ==
a universal model valid for all laser types does not exist the simplest model includes two systems of sub-levels: upper and lower within each sub-level system the fast transitions ensure that thermal equilibrium is reached quickly leading to the maxwellboltzmann statistics of excitations among sub-levels in each system (fig.1) the upper level is assumed to be metastable also gain and refractive index are assumed independent of a particular way of excitation
for good performance of the gain medium the separation between sub-levels should be larger than working temperature; then at pump frequency  the absorption dominates
in the case of amplification of optical signals the lasing frequency is called signal frequency however the same term is used even in the laser oscillators when amplified radiation is used to transfer energy rather than information the model below seems to work well for most optically-pumped solid-state lasers
=== cross-sections ===
the simple medium can be characterized with effective cross-sections of absorption and emission at frequencies and 
let be concentration of active centers in the solid-state lasers
let be concentration of active centers in the ground state
let be concentration of excited centers
let 
the relative concentrations can be defined as and 
the rate of transitions of an active center from ground state to the excited state can be expressed with and the rate of transitions back to the ground state can be expressed with  where and are effective cross-sections of absorption at the frequencies of the signal and the pump
and are the same for stimulated emission;
is rate of the spontaneous decay of the upper level
then the kinetic equation for relative populations can be written as follows: 
however these equations keep 
the absorption at the pump frequency and the gain at the signal frequency can be written as follows:  
=== steady-state solution ===
in many cases the gain medium works in a continuous-wave or quasi-continuous regime causing the time derivatives of populations to be negligible
the steady-state solution can be written: 
the dynamic saturation intensities can be defined:  
the absorption at strong signal: 
the gain at strong pump:  where is determinant of cross-section
gain never exceeds value  and absorption never exceeds value 
at given intensities  of pump and signal the gain and absorption can be expressed as follows:  
where    
=== identities ===
the following identities take place: 
the state of gain medium can be characterized with a single parameter such as population of the upper level gain or absorption
=== efficiency of the gain medium ===
the efficiency of a gain medium can be defined as 
within the same model the efficiency can be expressed as follows: 
for the efficient operation both intensities pump and signal should exceed their saturation intensities;  and 
the estimates above are valid for a medium uniformly filled with pump and signal light the spatial hole burning may slightly reduce the efficiency because some regions are pumped well but the pump is not efficiently withdrawn by the signal in the nodes of the interference of counter-propagating waves
