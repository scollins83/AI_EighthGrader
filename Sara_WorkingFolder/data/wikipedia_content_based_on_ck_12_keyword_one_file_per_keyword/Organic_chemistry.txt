organic chemistry is a chemistry subdiscipline involving the scientific study of the structure properties and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials i.e. matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms study of structure includes many physical and chemical methods to determine the chemical composition and the chemical constitution of organic compounds and materials study of properties includes both physical properties and chemical properties and uses similar methods as well as methods to evaluate chemical reactivity with the aim to understand the behavior of the organic matter in its pure form (when possible) but also in solutions mixtures and fabricated forms the study of organic reactions includes probing their scope through use in preparation of target compounds (e.g. natural products drugs polymers etc.) by chemical synthesis as well as the focused study of the reactivities of individual organic molecules both in the laboratory and via theoretical (in silico) study
the range of chemicals studied in organic chemistry include hydrocarbons (compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen) as well as myriad compositions based always on carbon but also containing other elements especially oxygen nitrogen sulfur phosphorus (these included in many organic chemicals in biology) and the radiostable elements of the halogens
in the modern era the range extends further into the periodic table with main group elements including:
group 1 and 2 organometallic compounds i.e. involving alkali (e.g. lithium sodium and potassium) or alkaline earth metals (e.g. magnesium)
metalloids (e.g. boron and silicon) or other metals (e.g. aluminium and tin)
in addition much modern research focuses on organic chemistry involving further organometallics including the lanthanides but especially the transition metals; (e.g. zinc copper palladium nickel cobalt titanium and chromium)
finally organic compounds form the basis of all earthly life and constitute a significant part of human endeavors in chemistry the bonding patterns open to carbon with its valence of fourformal single double and triple bonds as well as various structures with delocalized electronsmake the array of organic compounds structurally diverse and their range of applications enormous they either form the basis of or are important constituents of many commercial products including pharmaceuticals; petrochemicals and products made from them (including lubricants solvents etc.); plastics; fuels and explosives; etc as indicated the study of organic chemistry overlaps with organometallic chemistry and biochemistry but also with medicinal chemistry polymer chemistry as well as many aspects of materials science
== historyedit ==
before the nineteenth century chemists generally believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were endowed with a vital force that distinguished them from inorganic compounds according to the concept of vitalism (vital force theory) organic matter was endowed with a "vital force" during the first half of the nineteenth century some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported around 1816 michel chevreul started a study of soaps made from various fats and alkalis he separated the different acids that in combination with the alkali produced the soap since these were all individual compounds he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from organic sources) producing new compounds without "vital force" in 1828 friedrich whler produced the organic chemical urea (carbamide) a constituent of urine from the inorganic ammonium cyanate nh4cno in what is now called the whler synthesis although whler was always cautious about claiming that he had disproved the theory of vital force this event has often been thought of as a turning point
in 1856 william henry perkin while trying to manufacture quinine accidentally manufactured the organic dye now known as perkin's mauve through its great financial success this discovery greatly increased interest in organic chemistry
the crucial breakthrough for organic chemistry was the concept of chemical structure developed independently and simultaneously by friedrich august kekul and archibald scott couper in 1858 both men suggested that tetravalent carbon atoms could link to each other to form a carbon lattice and that the detailed patterns of atomic bonding could be discerned by skillful interpretations of appropriate chemical reactions
the pharmaceutical industry began in the last decade of the 19th century when the manufacturing of acetylsalicylic acid (more commonly referred to as aspirin) in germany was started by bayer the first time a drug was systematically improved was with arsphenamine (salvarsan) though numerous derivatives of the dangerous toxic atoxyl were examined by paul ehrlich and his group the compound with best effectiveness and toxicity characteristics was selected for production
early examples of organic reactions and applications were often serendipitous the latter half of the 19th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic compounds illustrative is the development of synthetic indigo the production of indigo from plant sources dropped from 19,000 tons in 1897 to 1,000 tons by 1914 thanks to the synthetic methods developed by adolf von baeyer in 2002 17,000 tons of synthetic indigo were produced from petrochemicals
in the early part of the 20th century polymers and enzymes were shown to be large organic molecules and petroleum was shown to be of biological origin
the multistep synthesis of complex organic compounds is called total synthesis total synthesis of complex natural compounds increased in complexity to glucose and terpineol for example cholesterol-related compounds have opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified derivatives since the start of the 20th century complexity of total syntheses has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as lysergic acid and vitamin b12
the development of organic chemistry benefited from the discovery of petroleum and the development of the petrochemical industry the conversion of individual compounds obtained from petroleum into different compound types by various chemical processes led to the birth of the petrochemical industry which successfully manufactured artificial rubbers various organic adhesives property-modifying petroleum additives and plastics
the majority of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms are in fact carbon compounds so the association between organic chemistry and biochemistry is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry although the history of biochemistry might be taken to span some four centuries fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term biochemistry was coined around the start of 20th century research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century without any indication of slackening in the rate of increase as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as biosis previews and biological abstracts which began in the 1920s as a single annual volume but has grown so drastically that by the end of the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic database
== characterizationedit ==
since organic compounds often exist as mixtures a variety of techniques have also been developed to assess purity especially important being chromatography techniques such as hplc and gas chromatography traditional methods of separation include distillation crystallization and solvent extraction
organic compounds were traditionally characterized by a variety of chemical tests called "wet methods" but such tests have been largely displaced by spectroscopic or other computer-intensive methods of analysis listed in approximate order of utility the chief analytical methods are:
nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy is the most commonly used technique often permitting complete assignment of atom connectivity and even stereochemistry using correlation spectroscopy the principal constituent atoms of organic chemistry hydrogen and carbon exist naturally with nmr-responsive isotopes respectively 1h and 13c
elemental analysis: a destructive method used to determine the elemental composition of a molecule see also mass spectrometry below
mass spectrometry indicates the molecular weight of a compound and from the fragmentation patterns its structure high resolution mass spectrometry can usually identify the exact formula of a compound and is used in lieu of elemental analysis in former times mass spectrometry was restricted to neutral molecules exhibiting some volatility but advanced ionization techniques allow one to obtain the "mass spec" of virtually any organic compound
crystallography is an unambiguous method for determining molecular geometry the proviso being that single crystals of the material must be available and the crystal must be representative of the sample highly automated software allows a structure to be determined within hours of obtaining a suitable crystal
traditional spectroscopic methods such as infrared spectroscopy optical rotation uv/vis spectroscopy provide relatively nonspecific structural information but remain in use for specific classes of compounds traditionally refractive index and density were also important for substance identification
== propertiesedit ==
physical properties of organic compounds typically of interest include both quantitative and qualitative features quantitative information includes melting point boiling point and index of refraction qualitative properties include odor consistency solubility and color
=== melting and boiling propertiesedit ===
organic compounds typically melt and many boil in contrast while inorganic materials generally can be melted many do not boil tending instead to degrade in earlier times the melting point (m.p.) and boiling point (b.p.) provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds the melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight some organic compounds especially symmetrical ones sublime that is they evaporate without melting a well-known example of a sublimable organic compound is para-dichlorobenzene the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300 c although some exceptions exist
=== solubilityedit ===
neutral organic compounds tend to be hydrophobic; that is they are less soluble in water than in organic solvents exceptions include organic compounds that contain ionizable (which can be converted in ions) groups as well as low molecular weight alcohols amines and carboxylic acids where hydrogen bonding occurs organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic solvents solvents can be either pure substances like ether or ethyl alcohol or mixtures such as the paraffinic solvents such as the various petroleum ethers and white spirits or the range of pure or mixed aromatic solvents obtained from petroleum or tar fractions by physical separation or by chemical conversion solubility in the different solvents depends upon the solvent type and on the functional groups if present
=== solid state propertiesedit ===
various specialized properties of molecular crystals and organic polymers with conjugated systems are of interest depending on applications e.g thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical such as piezoelectricity electrical conductivity (see conductive polymers and organic semiconductors) and electro-optical (e.g non-linear optics) properties for historical reasons such properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of polymer science and materials science
== nomenclatureedit ==
the names of organic compounds are either systematic following logically from a set of rules or nonsystematic following various traditions systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from iupac systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a parent structure within the molecule of interest this parent name is then modified by prefixes suffixes and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure given that millions of organic compounds are known rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome thus iupac recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds but not complex molecules to use the systematic naming one must know the structures and names of the parent structures parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons heterocycles and monofunctionalized derivatives thereof
nonsystematic nomenclature is simpler and unambiguous at least to organic chemists nonsystematic names do not indicate the structure of the compound they are common for complex molecules which includes most natural products thus the informally named lysergic acid diethylamide is systematically named (6ar,9r)-n,n-diethyl-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo-[4,3-fg] quinoline-9-carboxamide
with the increased use of computing other naming methods have evolved that are intended to be interpreted by machines two popular formats are smiles and inchi
=== structural drawingsedit ===
organic molecules are described more commonly by drawings or structural formulas combinations of drawings and chemical symbols the line-angle formula is simple and unambiguous in this system the endpoints and intersections of each line represent one carbon and hydrogen atoms can either be notated explicitly or assumed to be present as implied by tetravalent carbon the depiction of organic compounds with drawings is greatly simplified by the fact that carbon in almost all organic compounds has four bonds nitrogen three oxygen two and hydrogen one
== classification of organic compoundsedit ==
=== functional groupsedit ===
the concept of functional groups is central in organic chemistry both as a means to classify structures and for predicting properties a functional group is a molecular module and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed within limits to be the same in a variety of molecules functional groups can have decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic compounds molecules are classified on the basis of their functional groups alcohols for example all have the subunit c-o-h all alcohols tend to be somewhat hydrophilic usually form esters and usually can be converted to the corresponding halides most functional groups feature heteroatoms (atoms other than c and h) organic compounds are classified according to functional groups alcohols carboxylic acids amines etc
=== aliphatic compoundsedit ===
the aliphatic hydrocarbons are subdivided into three groups of homologous series according to their state of saturation:
paraffins which are alkanes without any double or triple bonds
olefins or alkenes which contain one or more double bonds i.e di-olefins (dienes) or poly-olefins
alkynes which have one or more triple bonds
the rest of the group is classed according to the functional groups present such compounds can be "straight-chain" branched-chain or cyclic the degree of branching affects characteristics such as the octane number or cetane number in petroleum chemistry
both saturated (alicyclic) compounds and unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives the most stable rings contain five or six carbon atoms but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common the smallest cycloalkane family is the three-membered cyclopropane ((ch2)3) saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond cycloalkanes do not contain multiple bonds whereas the cycloalkenes and the cycloalkynes do
=== aromatic compoundsedit ===
aromatic hydrocarbons contain conjugated double bonds this means that every carbon atom in the ring is sp2 hybridized allowing for added stability the most important example is benzene the structure of which was formulated by kekul who first proposed the delocalization or resonance principle for explaining its structure for "conventional" cyclic compounds aromaticity is conferred by the presence of 4n + 2 delocalized pi electrons where n is an integer particular instability (antiaromaticity) is conferred by the presence of 4n conjugated pi electrons
=== heterocyclic compoundsedit ===
the characteristics of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if heteroatoms are present which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the ring (exocyclic) or as a member of the ring itself (endocyclic) in the case of the latter the ring is termed a heterocycle pyridine and furan are examples of aromatic heterocycles while piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are the corresponding alicyclic heterocycles the heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules is generally oxygen sulfur or nitrogen with the latter being particularly common in biochemical systems
heterocycles are commonly found in a wide range of products including aniline dyes and medicines additionally they are prevalent in a wide range of biochemical compounds such as alkaloids vitamins steroids and nucleic acids (e.g dna rna)
rings can fuse with other rings on an edge to give polycyclic compounds the purine nucleoside bases are notable polycyclic aromatic heterocycles rings can also fuse on a "corner" such that one atom (almost always carbon) has two bonds going to one ring and two to another such compounds are termed spiro and are important in a number of natural products
=== polymersedit ===
one important property of carbon is that it readily forms chains or networks that are linked by carbon-carbon (carbon to carbon) bonds the linking process is called polymerization while the chains or networks are called polymers the source compound is called a monomer
two main groups of polymers exist: synthetic polymers and biopolymers synthetic polymers are artificially manufactured and are commonly referred to as industrial polymers biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural environment or without human intervention
since the invention of the first synthetic polymer product bakelite synthetic polymer products have frequently been invented
common synthetic organic polymers are polyethylene (polythene) polypropylene nylon teflon (ptfe) polystyrene polyesters polymethylmethacrylate (called perspex and plexiglas) and polyvinylchloride (pvc)
both synthetic and natural rubber are polymers
varieties of each synthetic polymer product may exist for purposes of a specific use changing the conditions of polymerization alters the chemical composition of the product and its properties these alterations include the chain length or branching or the tacticity
with a single monomer as a start the product is a homopolymer
secondary component(s) may be added to create a heteropolymer (co-polymer) and the degree of clustering of the different components can also be controlled
physical characteristics such as hardness density mechanical or tensile strength abrasion resistance heat resistance transparency colour etc will depend on the final composition
=== biomoleculesedit ===
biomolecular chemistry is a major category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by biochemists many complex multi-functional group molecules are important in living organisms some are long-chain biopolymers and these include peptides dna rna and the polysaccharides such as starches in animals and celluloses in plants the other main classes are amino acids (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins) carbohydrates (which includes the polysaccharides) the nucleic acids (which include dna and rna as polymers) and the lipids in addition animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the krebs cycle and produces isoprene the most common hydrocarbon in animals isoprenes in animals form the important steroid structural (cholesterol) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form terpenes terpenoids some alkaloids and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the latex of various species of plants which is the basis for making rubber

=== small moleculesedit ===
in pharmacology an important group of organic compounds is small molecules also referred to as 'small organic compounds' in this context a small molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active but is not a polymer in practice small molecules have a molar mass less than approximately 1000 g/mol
=== fullerenesedit ===
fullerenes and carbon nanotubes carbon compounds with spheroidal and tubular structures have stimulated much research into the related field of materials science the first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by sir harold w kroto (one of the authors of this article) of the united kingdom and by richard e smalley and robert f curl jr. of the united states using a laser to vaporize graphite rods in an atmosphere of helium gas these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms (c60) joined together by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal facesa design that resembles a football or soccer ball in 1996 the trio was awarded the nobel prize for their pioneering efforts the c60 molecule was named buckminsterfullerene (or more simply the buckyball) after the american architect r buckminster fuller whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles the elongated cousins of buckyballs carbon nanotubes were identified in 1991 by iijima sumio of japan
=== othersedit ===
organic compounds containing bonds of carbon to nitrogen oxygen and the halogens are not normally grouped separately others are sometimes put into major groups within organic chemistry and discussed under titles such as organosulfur chemistry organometallic chemistry organophosphorus chemistry and organosilicon chemistry
== organic reactionsedit ==
organic reactions are chemical reactions involving organic compounds many of these reactions are associated with functional groups the general theory of these reactions involves careful analysis of such properties as the electron affinity of key atoms bond strengths and steric hindrance these factors can determine the relative stability of short-lived reactive intermediates which usually directly determine the path of the reaction
the basic reaction types are: addition reactions elimination reactions substitution reactions pericyclic reactions rearrangement reactions and redox reactions an example of a common reaction is a substitution reaction written as:
nu + c-x c-nu + x
where x is some functional group and nu is a nucleophile
the number of possible organic reactions is basically infinite however certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common or useful reactions each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequencealthough the detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone
the stepwise course of any given reaction mechanism can be represented using arrow pushing techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement of electrons as starting materials transition through intermediates to final products
== organic synthesisedit ==
synthetic organic chemistry is an applied science as it borders engineering the "design analysis and/or construction of works for practical purposes" organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem solving task where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule the synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule for example a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory the scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called total synthesis
strategies to design a synthesis include retrosynthesis popularized by e.j corey starts with the target molecule and splices it to pieces according to known reactions the pieces or the proposed precursors receive the same treatment until available and ideally inexpensive starting materials are reached then the retrosynthesis is written in the opposite direction to give the synthesis a "synthetic tree" can be constructed because each compound and also each precursor has multiple syntheses
