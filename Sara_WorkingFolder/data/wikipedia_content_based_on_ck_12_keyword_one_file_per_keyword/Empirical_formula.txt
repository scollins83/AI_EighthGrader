in chemistry the empirical formula of a chemical compound is the simplest positive integer ratio of atoms present in a compound a simple example of this concept is that the empirical formula of sulfur monoxide or so would simply be so as is the empirical formula of disulfur dioxide s2o2 this means that sulfur monoxide and disulfur dioxide both compounds of sulfur and oxygen will have the same empirical formula
an empirical formula makes no mention of the arrangement or number of atoms it is standard for many ionic compounds like cacl2 and for macromolecules such as sio2
the molecular formula on the other hand shows the number of each type of atom in a molecule also the structural formula shows the arrangement of the molecule it is possible for different types of compounds to have equal empirical formulas
== examples ==
glucose (c
6h
12o
6) ribose (c
5h
10o
5) acetic acid (c
2h
4o
2) and formaldehyde (ch
2o) all have different molecular formulas but the same empirical formula: ch
2o this is the actual molecular formula for formaldehyde but acetic acid has double the number of atoms ribose has five times the number of atoms and glucose has six times the number of atoms
the chemical compound n-hexane has the structural formula ch
3ch
2ch
2ch
2ch
2ch
3 which shows that it has 6 carbon atoms arranged in a chain and 14 hydrogen atoms hexane's molecular formula is c
6h
14 and its empirical formula is c
3h
7 showing a c:h ratio of 3:7
== calculation ==
suppose you are given a compound such as methyl acetate a solvent commonly used in paints inks and adhesives when methyl acetate was chemically analyzed it was discovered to have 48.64% carbon (c) 8.16% hydrogen (h) and 43.20% oxygen (o) for the purposes of determining empirical formulas we assume that we have 100 g of the compound if this is the case the percentages will be equal to the mass of each element in grams
step 1
change each percentage to an expression of the mass of each element in grams that is 48.64% c becomes 48.64 g c 8.16% h becomes 8.16 g h and 43.20% o becomes 43.20 g o
step 2
convert the amount of each element in grams to its amount in moles
step 3
divide each of the found values by the smallest of these values (2.7)
step 4
if necessary multiply these numbers by integers in order to get whole numbers; if an operation is done to one of the numbers it must be done to all of them
thus the empirical formula of methyl acetate is c
3h
6o
2 this formula also happens to be methyl acetate's molecular formula
