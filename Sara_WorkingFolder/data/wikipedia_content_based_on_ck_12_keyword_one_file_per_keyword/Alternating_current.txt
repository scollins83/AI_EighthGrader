alternating current (ac) is an electric current in which the flow of electric charge periodically reverses direction whereas in direct current (dc also dc) the flow of electric charge is only in one direction the abbreviations ac and dc are often used to mean simply alternating and direct as when they modify current or voltage
ac is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences the usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave in certain applications different waveforms are used such as triangular or square waves
audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current these types of alternating current carry information encoded (or modulated) onto the ac signal such as sound (audio) or images (video) these currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission
== transmission distribution and domestic power supplyedit ==
the reason that electric power is distributed as alternating current is that ac voltage may be increased or decreased with a transformer this allows the power to be transmitted through power lines efficiently at high voltage which reduces the power lost as heat due to resistance of the wire and the voltage to be reduced to safe levels for use by the customer use of a higher voltage leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power the power losses () in a conductor are a product of the square of the current (i) and the resistance (r) of the conductor described by the formula
this means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire if the current is doubled the power loss will be four times greater
the power transmitted is equal to the product of the current and the voltage (assuming no phase difference); that is
thus the same amount of power can be transmitted with a lower current by increasing the voltage it is therefore advantageous when transmitting large amounts of power to distribute the power with high voltages (often hundreds of kilovolts)
however high voltages also have disadvantages the main one being the increased insulation required and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling in a power plant power is generated at a convenient voltage for the design of a generator and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission near the loads the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment consumer voltages vary depending on the country and size of load but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases
the utilization voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different mains power systems found in the world
modern high-voltage direct-current (hvdc) electric power transmission systems contrast with the more common alternating-current systems as a means for the efficient bulk transmission of electrical power over long distances hvdc systems however tend to be more expensive and less efficient over shorter distances than transformers transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible when edison westinghouse and tesla were designing their power systems since there was then no way to economically convert ac power to dc and back again at the necessary voltages
three-phase electrical generation is very common the simplest case is three separate coils in the generator stator that are physically offset by an angle of 120 to each other three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120 out of phase to each other if coils are added opposite to these (60 spacing) they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together
in practice higher "pole orders" are commonly used for example a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10 spacing) the advantage is that lower speeds can be used for example a 2-pole machine running at 3600 rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600 rpm produce the same frequency this is much more practical for larger machines
if the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases no current flows through the neutral point even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents non-linear loads (e.g. computers) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors
for three-phase at utilization voltages a four-wire system is often used when stepping down three-phase a transformer with a delta (3-wire) primary and a star (4-wire center-earthed) secondary is often used so there is no need for a neutral on the supply side
for smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and the neutral or two phases and the neutral are taken to the property for larger installations all three phases and the neutral are taken to the main distribution panel from the three-phase main panel both single and three-phase circuits may lead off
three-wire single-phase systems with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in north america this arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "two phase" a similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the uk small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55 v between each power conductor and earth this significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110 v between the two conductors for running the tools
a third wire called the bond (or earth) wire is often connected between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground this conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures there is always a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current for as long as it takes for the system to clear the fault this low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible bringing the electrical system to a safe state all bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel as is the neutral/identified conductor if present
== ac power supply frequenciesedit ==
the frequency of the electrical system varies by country and sometimes within a country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60 hertz some countries have a mixture of 50 hz and 60 hz supplies notably electricity power transmission in japan
a low frequency eases the design of electric motors particularly for hoisting crushing and rolling applications and commutator-type traction motors for applications such as railways however low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in arc lamps and incandescent light bulbs the use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower impedance losses which are proportional to frequency the original niagara falls generators were built to produce 25 hz power as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors while still allowing incandescent lighting to operate (although with noticeable flicker) most of the 25 hz residential and commercial customers for niagara falls power were converted to 60 hz by the late 1950s although some 25 hz industrial customers still existed as of the start of the 21st century 16.7 hz power (formerly 16 2/3 hz) is still used in some european rail systems such as in austria germany norway sweden and switzerland
off-shore military textile industry marine aircraft and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400 hz for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds
computer mainframe systems are often powered by 415 hz using customer-supplied 35 or 70 kva motor-generator sets smaller mainframes may have an internal 415 hz m-g set in any case the input to the m-g set is the local customary voltage and frequency variously 200 (japan) 208 240 (north america) 380 400 or 415 (europe) volts and variously 50 or 60 hz
== effects at high frequenciesedit ==
a direct current flows uniformly throughout the cross-section of a uniform wire an alternating current of any frequency is forced away from the wire's center toward its outer surface this is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity toward the center of materials with high conductivity this phenomenon is called skin effect
at very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire but effectively flows on the surface of the wire within a thickness of a few skin depths the skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63% even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (5060 hz) non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors for example the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57 mm at 60 hz so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost
since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced this increases the effective ac resistance of the conductor since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area the ac resistance often is many times higher than the dc resistance causing a much higher energy loss due to ohmic heating (also called i2r loss)
=== techniques for reducing ac resistanceedit ===
for low to medium frequencies conductors can be divided into stranded wires each insulated from one other and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle wire constructed using this technique is called litz wire this measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors litz wire is used for making high-q inductors reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current (up to hundreds of kilohertz) such as switch-mode power supplies and radio frequency transformers
==== techniques for reducing radiation lossedit ====
as written above an alternating current is made of electric charge under periodic acceleration which causes radiation of electromagnetic waves energy that is radiated is lost depending on the frequency different techniques are used to minimize the loss due to radiation
==== twisted pairsedit ====
at frequencies up to about 1 ghz pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable forming a twisted pair this reduces losses from electromagnetic radiation and inductive coupling a twisted pair must be used with a balanced signalling system so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents each wire in a twisted pair radiates a signal but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire resulting in almost no radiation loss
==== coaxial cablesedit ====
coaxial cables are commonly used at audio frequencies and above for convenience a coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube separated by a dielectric layer the current flowing on the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the tube the electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5 ghz for microwave frequencies greater than 5 ghz the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss
==== waveguidesedit ====
waveguides are similar to coax cables as both consist of tubes with the biggest difference being that the waveguide has no inner conductor waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section but rectangular cross sections are the most common because waveguides do not have an inner conductor to carry a return current waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an electric current but rather by means of a guided electromagnetic field although surface currents do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides those surface currents do not carry power power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields the surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide
waveguides have dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the alternating current to be transmitted so they are only feasible at microwave frequencies in addition to this mechanical feasibility electrical resistance of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide cause dissipation of power (surface currents flowing on lossy conductors dissipate power) at higher frequencies the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large
==== fiber opticsedit ====
at frequencies greater than 200 ghz waveguide dimensions become impractically small and the ohmic losses in the waveguide walls become large instead fiber optics which are a form of dielectric waveguides can be used for such frequencies the concepts of voltages and currents are no longer used
== mathematics of ac voltagesedit ==
alternating currents are accompanied (or caused) by alternating voltages an ac voltage v can be described mathematically as a function of time by the following equation:
where
is the peak voltage (unit: volt)
is the angular frequency (unit: radians per second)
the angular frequency is related to the physical frequency (unit = hertz) which represents the number of cycles per second by the equation 
is the time (unit: second)
the peak-to-peak value of an ac voltage is defined as the difference between its positive peak and its negative peak since the maximum value of is +1 and the minimum value is 1 an ac voltage swings between and  the peak-to-peak voltage usually written as or  is therefore 
=== poweredit ===
the relationship between voltage and the power delivered is
where represents a load resistance
rather than using instantaneous power  it is more practical to use a time averaged power (where the averaging is performed over any integer number of cycles) therefore ac voltage is often expressed as a root mean square (rms) value written as  because
power oscillation
by the following trigonometric identity the power oscillation is double frequency of the voltage
=== root mean squareedit ===
for a sinusoidal voltage:
the factor is called the crest factor which varies for different waveforms
for a triangle waveform centered about zero
for a square waveform centered about zero
for an arbitrary periodic waveform of period :
=== exampleedit ===
to illustrate these concepts consider a 230 v ac mains supply used in many countries around the world it is so called because its root mean square value is 230 v this means that the time-averaged power delivered is equivalent to the power delivered by a dc voltage of 230 v to determine the peak voltage (amplitude) we can rearrange the above equation to:
for 230 v ac the peak voltage is therefore  which is about 325 v
== information transmissionedit ==
alternating current is used to transmit information as in the cases of telephone and cable television information signals are carried over a wide range of ac frequencies pots telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kilohertz close to the baseband audio frequency cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of megahertz these frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the same types of information over the air
== historyedit ==
the first alternator to produce alternating current was a dynamo electric generator based on michael faraday's principles constructed by the french instrument maker hippolyte pixii in 1832 pixii later added a commutator to his device to produce the (then) more commonly used direct current the earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by guillaume duchenne inventor and developer of electrotherapy in 1855 he announced that ac was superior to direct current for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions
alternating current technology had first developed in europe due to the work of guillaume duchenne (1850s) the hungarian ganz works (1870s) sebastian ziani de ferranti (1880s) lucien gaulard and galileo ferraris
in 1876 russian engineer pavel yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of ac the secondary windings could be connected to several 'electric candles' (arc lamps) of his own design the coils yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers
in 1878 the ganz factory budapest hungary began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and by 1883 had installed over fifty systems in austria-hungary their ac systems used arc and incandescent lamps generators and other equipment
a power transformer developed by lucien gaulard and john dixon gibbs was demonstrated in london in 1881 and attracted the interest of westinghouse they also exhibited the invention in turin in 1884
=== dc distribution systemsedit ===
during the initial years of electricity distribution edison's direct current was the standard for the united states and edison did not want to lose all his patent royalties direct current worked well with incandescent lamps which were the principal load of the day and with motors direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation direct-current generators could be easily paralleled allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability at the introduction of edison's system no practical ac motor was available edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption but this meter worked only with direct current
the principal drawback of direct-current distribution was that customer loads distribution and generation were all at the same voltage generally it was uneconomical to use a high voltage for transmission and reduce it for customer uses even with the edison 3-wire system (placing two 110-volt customer loads in series on a 220-volt supply) the high cost of conductors required generation to be close to customer loads otherwise losses made the system uneconomical to operate
=== transformersedit ===
alternating current systems can use transformers to change voltage from low to high level and back allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission possibly over great distances at high voltage with savings in the cost of conductors and energy losses
a bipolar open-core power transformer developed by lucien gaulard and john dixon gibbs was demonstrated in london in 1881 and attracted the interest of westinghouse they also exhibited the invention in turin in 1884 however these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads until about 1880 the paradigm for ac power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps the inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil
the direct current systems did not have these drawbacks giving it significant advantages over early ac systems
=== pioneersedit ===
in the autumn of 1884 kroly zipernowsky ott blthy and miksa dri (zbd) three engineers associated with the ganz factory determined that open-core devices were impractical as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage in their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called zbd transformers) they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a) wound around iron wire ring core or b) surrounded by iron wire core in both designs the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core with no intentional path through air (see toroidal cores below) the new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of gaulard and gibbs
the ganz factory in 1884 shipped the world's first five high-efficiency ac transformers this first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 w 40 hz 120:72 v 11.6:19.4 a ratio 1.67:1 one-phase shell form
the zbd patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected instead of series connected utilization loads the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 v) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 v initially preferred) when employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes businesses and public spaces
the other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source voltage intensive' (vsvi) systems' by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885 ott blthy also invented the first ac electricity meter
the ac power systems was developed and adopted rapidly after 1886 due to its ability to distribute electricity efficiently over long distances overcoming the limitations of the direct current system in 1886 the zbd engineers designed and the ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for the world's first power station that used ac generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network the steam-powered rome-cerchi power plant the reliability of the ac technology received impetus after the ganz works electrified a large european metropolis: rome in 1886
in the uk sebastian de ferranti who had been developing ac generators and transformers in london since 1882 redesigned the ac system at the grosvenor gallery power station in 1886 for the london electric supply corporation (lesco) including alternators of his own design and transformer designs similar to gaulard and gibbs in 1890 he designed their power station at deptford and converted the grosvenor gallery station across the thames into an electrical substation showing the way to integrate older plants into a universal ac supply system
in the us william stanley jr designed one of the first practical devices to transfer ac power efficiently between isolated circuits using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core his design called an induction coil was an early (1885) transformer stanley also worked on engineering and adapting european designs such as the gaulard and gibbs transformer for us entrepreneur george westinghouse who started building ac systems in 1886 the spread of westinghouse and other ac systems triggered a push back in late 1887 by thomas edison (a proponent of direct current) who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the "war of currents"
in 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional ac motor something these systems had lacked up till then the design an induction motor was independently invented by galileo ferraris and nikola tesla (with tesla's design being licensed by westinghouse in the us) this design was further developed into the modern practical three-phase form by mikhail dolivo-dobrovolsky and charles eugene lancelot brown
the ames hydroelectric generating plant (spring of 1891) and the original niagara falls adams power plant (august 25 1895) were among the first hydroelectric ac-power plants the first commercial power plant in the united states using three-phase alternating current was the hydroelectric mill creek no 1 hydroelectric plant near redlands california in 1893 designed by almirian decker decker's design incorporated 10,000-volt three-phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation transmission and motors used today
the jaruga hydroelectric power plant in croatia was set in operation on 28 august 1895 the two generators (42 hz 550 kw each) and the transformers were produced and installed by the hungarian company ganz the transmission line from the power plant to the city of ibenik was 11.5 kilometers (7.1 mi) long on wooden towers and the municipal distribution grid 3000 v/110 v included six transforming stations
alternating current circuit theory developed rapidly in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century notable contributors to the theoretical basis of alternating current calculations include charles steinmetz oliver heaviside and many others calculations in unbalanced three-phase systems were simplified by the symmetrical components methods discussed by charles legeyt fortescue in 1918
