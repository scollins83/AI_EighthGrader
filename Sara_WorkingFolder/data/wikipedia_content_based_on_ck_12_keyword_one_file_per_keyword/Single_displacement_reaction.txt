a single-displacement reaction also named single-replacement reaction is a type of oxidation-reduction chemical reaction when an element or ion moves out of one compound and into another - that is one element is replaced by another in a compound this is represented by the general reaction scheme:
this will most often occur if a is more reactive than b
a and b must be either:
different metals (hydrogen's behavior as a cation renders it as a metal here) in which case c represents an anion; or
halogens in which case c represents a cation
in either case when ac and bc are aqueous compounds (which is usually the case) c is a spectator ion
in the activity or reactivity series the metals with the highest propensity to donate their electrons to react are listed first and the most unreactive metals are listed last therefore a metal higher on the list is able to displace anything on the list below it the order of activity for metals from most reactive to least reactive is li k sr na ca mg al zn cr fe cd co ni sn pb h sb as bi cu hg ag pd pt au similarly the halogens with the highest propensity to acquire electrons are the most reactive the activity series for halogens from highest to lowest is f cl br i
due to the free state nature of a and b all single displacement reactions are also oxidation-reduction reactions where the key event is the movement of electrons from one reactant to another when a and b are metals a is always oxidized and b is always reduced since halogens prefer to gain electrons a is reduced (from a 0 to 1) and b is oxidized (from 1 to 0) when a and b represent those elements
a and b may have different charge as ions and therefore some balancing of the equation may be necessary for example the reaction between silver nitrate agno3 (which contains an ag+ ion) and zinc zn forms silver ag and zinc nitrate zn(no3)2 (which contains a zn2+ ion)
2agno3(aq) + zn(s) 2ag(s) + zn(no3)2(aq)
all simple metal with acid reactions are single displacement reactions for example the reaction between magnesium mg and hydrochloric acid hcl forms magnesium chloride mgcl2 and hydrogen h2
mg(s) + 2 hcl(aq) mgcl2(aq) + h2(g)
== cation replacement ==
one cation replaces another a cation is a positively charged ion or a metal when it is written in generic symbols it is written out like this:
x + yz xz + y
element x has replaced y in compound yz to become a new compound xz and the free element y this is an oxidationreduction reaction wherein element y is reduced from a cation into the elemental form and element x is oxidized from the elemental form into a cation
some examples are:
cu + 2agno3 2ag + cu(no3)2
fe + cu(no3)2 fe(no3)2 + cu
ca + 2h2o ca(oh)2 + h2
zn + 2hcl zncl2 + h2
note that if the reactant in elemental form is not the more reactive metal then no reaction will occur some examples of this would be the reverse reactions to these:
ag + cu(no3)2 no reaction
au + hcl no reaction
== anion replacement ==
one anion replaces another an anion is a negatively charged ion or a nonmetal written using generic symbol it is:
a + xy xa + y
element a has replaced y (in the compound xy) to form a new compound xa and the free element y this is an oxidation-reduction reaction wherein element a is reduced from the elemental form into an anion and element y is oxidized from an anion into the elemental form
some of the few examples that involve halogens are shown here:
cl2 + 2nabr 2nacl + br2
br2 + 2ki 2kbr + i2
again the less reactive halogen cannot replace the more reactive halogen:
i2 + 2kbr no reaction
