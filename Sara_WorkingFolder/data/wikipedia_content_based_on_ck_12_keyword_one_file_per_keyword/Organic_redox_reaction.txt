organic reductions or organic oxidations or organic redox reactions are redox reactions that take place with organic compounds in organic chemistry oxidations and reductions are different from ordinary redox reactions because many reactions carry the name but do not actually involve electron transfer in the electrochemical sense of the word
simple functional groups can be arranged in order of increasing oxidation state the oxidation numbers are only an approximation:
oxidation number -4 for alkanes
oxidation number -2 for alkenes alcohols alkyl halides amines
oxidation number 0 for alkynes ketones aldehydes geminal diols
oxidation number +2 for carboxylic acids amides chloroform and
oxidation number +4 for carbon dioxide tetrachloromethane
when methane is oxidized to carbon dioxide its oxidation number changes from -4 to +4 classical reductions include alkene reduction to alkanes and classical oxidations include oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes in oxidations electrons are removed and the electron density of a molecule is reduced in reductions electron density increases when electrons are added to the molecule this terminology is always centered on the organic compound for example it is usual to refer to the reduction of a ketone by lithium aluminium hydride but not to the oxidation of lithium aluminium hydride by a ketone many oxidations involve removal of hydrogen atoms from the organic molecule and the reverse reduction adds hydrogens to an organic molecule
many reactions classified as reductions also appear in other classes for instance conversion of the ketone to an alcohol by lithium aluminium hydride can be considered a reduction but the hydride is also a good nucleophile in nucleophilic substitution many redox reactions in organic chemistry have coupling reaction reaction mechanism involving free radical intermediates true organic redox chemistry can be found in electrochemical organic synthesis or electrosynthesis examples of organic reactions that can take place in an electrochemical cell are the kolbe electrolysis
in disproportionation reactions the reactant is both oxidised and reduced in the same chemical reaction forming two separate compounds
asymmetric catalytic reductions and asymmetric catalytic oxidations are important in asymmetric synthesis

most oxidations are conducted with air or oxygen these oxidation include routes to chemical compounds remediation of pollutants and combustion several reaction mechanisms exist for organic oxidations:
single electron transfer
oxidations through ester intermediates with chromic acid or manganese dioxide
hydrogen atom transfer as in free radical halogenation
oxidation involving ozone in ozonolysis and peroxides
oxidations involving an elimination reaction mechanism such as the swern oxidation the kornblum oxidation and with reagents such as ibx acid and dess-martin periodinane
oxidation by nitroxide radicals fremy's salt or tempo
== organic reductionsedit ==
several reaction mechanisms exist for organic reductions:
direct electron transfer in one-electron reduction with the birch reduction as example
hydride transfer in reductions with for example lithium aluminium hydride or a hydride shift as in the meerwein-ponndorf-verley reduction
hydrogen reductions with a catalyst such as the lindlar catalyst or the adkins catalyst or in specific reductions such as the rosenmund reduction
disproportionation reaction such as the cannizzaro reaction
reductions that do not fit in any reduction reaction mechanism and in which just the change in oxidation state is reflected include the wolff-kishner reaction
