in mathematics a binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result it is au fundamental property of many binary operations and many mathematical proofs depend on it most familiar as the name of the property that says "3 + 4 = 17+ 38=1738" or "2 5 = 5 2" the property can also be used in more advanced settings the name is needed because there are operations such as division and subtraction that do not have it (for example "3 5 5 3") such operations are not commutative or noncommutative operations the idea that simple operations such as multiplication and addition of numbers are commutative was for many years implicitly assumed and the property was not named until the 19th century when mathematics started to become formalized
== common uses ==
the commutative property (or commutative law) is a property generally associated with binary operations and functions if the commutative property holds for a pair of elements under a certain binary operation then the two elements are said to commute under that operation
== mathematical definitions ==
the term "commutative" is used in several related senses
== examples ==
=== commutative operations in everyday life ===
putting on socks resembles a commutative operation since which sock is put on first is unimportant either way the result (having both socks on) is the same in contrast putting on underwear and trousers is not commutative
the commutativity of addition is observed when paying for an item with cash regardless of the order the bills are handed over in they always give the same total
=== commutative operations in mathematics ===
two well-known examples of commutative binary operations:
the addition of real numbers is commutative since
for example 4 + 5 = 5 + 4 since both expressions equal 9
the multiplication of real numbers is commutative since
for example 3 5 = 5 3 since both expressions equal 15
some binary truth functions are also commutative since the truth tables for the functions are the same when one changes the order of the operands
for example the logical biconditional function p q is equivalent to q p this function is also written as p iff q or as p q or as epq
the last form is an example of the most concise notation in the article on truth functions which lists the sixteen possible binary truth functions of which eight are commutative: vpq = vqp; apq (or) = aqp; dpq (nand) = dqp; epq (iff) = eqp; jpq = jqp; kpq (and) = kqp; xpq (nor) = xqp; opq = oqp
further examples of commutative binary operations include addition and multiplication of complex numbers addition and scalar multiplication of vectors and intersection and union of sets
=== noncommutative operations in everyday life ===
concatenation the act of joining character strings together is a noncommutative operation for example
washing and drying clothes resembles a noncommutative operation; washing and then drying produces a markedly different result to drying and then washing
rotating a book 90 around a vertical axis then 90 around a horizontal axis produces a different orientation than when the rotations are performed in the opposite order
the twists of the rubik's cube are noncommutative this can be studied using group theory
also thought processes are noncommutative: a person asked a question (a) and then a question (b) may give different answers to each question than a person asked first (b) and then (a) because asking a question may change the person's state of mind
=== noncommutative operations in mathematics ===
some noncommutative binary operations:
subtraction is noncommutative since
division is noncommutative since
some truth functions are noncommutative since the truth tables for the functions are different when one changes the order of the operands
for example the truth tables for f (a,b) = a b (a and not b) and f (b,a) = b a are
matrix multiplication is noncommutative since
the vector product (or cross product) of two vectors in three dimensions is anti-commutative i.e. b a = (a b)
== history and etymology ==
records of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times the egyptians used the commutative property of multiplication to simplify computing products euclid is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book elements formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions today the commutative property is a well known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics
the first recorded use of the term commutative was in a memoir by franois servois in 1814 which used the word commutatives when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property the word is a combination of the french word commuter meaning "to substitute or switch" and the suffix -ative meaning "tending to" so the word literally means "tending to substitute or switch." the term then appeared in english in philosophical transactions of the royal society in 1844
== propositional logic ==
=== rule of replacement ===
in truth-functional propositional logic commutation or commutativity refer to two valid rules of replacement the rules allow one to transpose propositional variables within logical expressions in logical proofs the rules are:
and
where "" is a metalogical symbol representing "can be replaced in a proof with."
=== truth functional connectives ===
commutativity is a property of some logical connectives of truth functional propositional logic the following logical equivalences demonstrate that commutativity is a property of particular connectives the following are truth-functional tautologies
commutativity of conjunction
commutativity of disjunction
commutativity of implication (also called the law of permutation)
commutativity of equivalence (also called the complete commutative law of equivalence)
== set theory ==
in group and set theory many algebraic structures are called commutative when certain operands satisfy the commutative property in higher branches of mathematics such as analysis and linear algebra the commutativity of well-known operations (such as addition and multiplication on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs
== mathematical structures and commutativity ==
a commutative semigroup is a set endowed with a total associative and commutative operation
if the operation additionally has an identity element we have a commutative monoid
an abelian group or commutative group is a group whose group operation is commutative
a commutative ring is a ring whose multiplication is commutative (addition in a ring is always commutative.)
in a field both addition and multiplication are commutative
== related properties ==
=== associativity ===
the associative property is closely related to the commutative property the associative property of an expression containing two or more occurrences of the same operator states that the order operations are performed in does not affect the final result as long as the order of terms doesn't change in contrast the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result
most commutative operations encountered in practice are also associative however commutativity does not imply associativity a counterexample is the function
which is clearly commutative (interchanging x and y does not affect the result) but it is not associative (since for example but ) more such examples may be found in commutative non-associative magmas
=== symmetry ===
some forms of symmetry can be directly linked to commutativity when a commutative operator is written as a binary function then the resulting function is symmetric across the line y = x as an example if we let a function f represent addition (a commutative operation) so that f(x,y) = x + y then f is a symmetric function which can be seen in the image on the right
for relations a symmetric relation is analogous to a commutative operation in that if a relation r is symmetric then 
== non-commuting operators in quantum mechanics ==
in quantum mechanics as formulated by schrdinger physical variables are represented by linear operators such as x (meaning multiply by x) and  these two operators do not commute as may be seen by considering the effect of their compositions and (also called products of operators) on a one-dimensional wave function :
according to the uncertainty principle of heisenberg if the two operators representing a pair of variables do not commute then that pair of variables are mutually complementary which means they cannot be simultaneously measured or known precisely for example the position and the linear momentum in the x-direction of a particle are represented respectively by the operators and (where is the reduced planck constant) this is the same example except for the constant  so again the operators do not commute and the physical meaning is that the position and linear momentum in a given direction are complementary
