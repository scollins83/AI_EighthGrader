in linguistics and semiotics a notation is a system of graphics or symbols characters and abbreviated expressions used in artistic and scientific disciplines to represent technical facts and quantities by convention therefore a notation is a collection of related symbols that are each given an arbitrary meaning created to facilitate structured communication within a domain knowledge or field of study
standard notations refer to general agreements in the way things are written or denoted the term is generally used in technical and scientific areas of study like mathematics physics chemistry and biology but can also be seen in areas like business economics and music
== written communication ==
phonographic writing systems by definition use symbols to represent components of auditory language i.e speech which in turn refers to things or ideas the five main kinds of phonographic notational system are the alphabet and syllabary some written languages are more consistent in their correlation of written symbol or grapheme and sound or phoneme and are therefore considered to have better phonemic orography
ideographic writing by definition refers to things or ideas independently of their pronunciation in any language all of the notational systems listed below are ideographic some ideographic systems are also pictograms that convey meaning through their pictorial resemblance to a physical object
=== biology and medicine ===
nucleic acid notation

energy systems language
=== chemistry ===
chemical formulas are a way of expressing information about the atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound e.g h
2o or c
6h
12o
6

bnf (backus normal form or backusnaur form) and ebnf (extended backus-naur form) are the two main notation techniques for context-free grammars
hungarian notation is an identifier naming convention in computer programming that represents the type or intended use of a variable with a specific pattern within its name
mathematical markup languages are computer notations for representing mathematical formulae
various notations have been developed to specify regular expressions
=== logic ===
a variety of symbols are used to express logical ideas; see the list of logic symbols
=== management ===
time and motion study symbols such as therbligs

mathematical notation is used to represent various kinds of mathematical ideas
all types of notation in probability
cartesian coordinate system for representing position and other spatial concepts in analytic geometry
notation for differentiation common representations of the derivative in calculus
big o notation used for example in analysis to represent less significant elements of an expression to indicate that they will be neglected

steinhausmoser notation
numeral systems notation for writing numbers including
arabic numerals
roman numerals
scientific notation for expressing large and small numbers
sign-value notation using signs or symbols to represent numbers
positional notation also known as place-value notation in which each position is related to the next by a multiplier which is called the base of that numeral system
binary notation a positional notation in base two
octal notation a positional notation in base eight used in some computers

=== physics ===
braket notation or dirac notation is another representation of probability in quantum mechanics
tensor index notation is used when formulating physics (particularly continuum mechanics electromagnetism relativistic quantum mechanics and field theory and general relativity) in the language of tensors
=== typographical conventions ===
infix notation the common arithmetic and logical formula notation such as a+b-c
polish notation or "prefix notation" which places the operator before the operands (arguments) such as + a b
reverse polish notation or "postfix notation" which places the operator after the operands such as a b +
=== sports and games ===
baseball scorekeeping to represent a game of baseball
juggling notation to represent juggling patterns
== graphical notations ==
=== music ===
musical notation permits a composer to express musical ideas in a musical composition which can be read and interpreted during performance by a trained musician; there are many different ways to do this (hundreds have been proposed) although staff notation provides by far the most widely used modern musical symbols
=== dance and movement ===
benesh movement notation permits a graphical representation of human bodily movements
laban movement analysis or labanotation permits a graphical representation of human bodily movements
eshkol-wachman movement notation permits a graphical representation of bodily movements of other species in addition to humans and indeed any kind of movement (e.g aircraft aerobatics)
aresti aerobatic symbols provides a way to represent flight maneuvers in aerobatics
=== science ===
feynman diagrams permit a graphical representation of a perturbative contribution to the transition amplitude or correlation function of a quantum mechanical or statistical field theory
structural formulas are graphical representations of molecules
