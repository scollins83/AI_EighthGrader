the cenozoic era (pronunciation: /sinzok s-/; also cnozoic caenozoic or cainozoic pronunciation: /kanzok ke-/; meaning "new life" from greek kainos "new" and zoe "life") is the current and most recent of the three phanerozoic geological eras following the mesozoic era and covering the period from 66 million years ago to present day
the cenozoic is also known as the age of mammals because of large mammals that dominated such as entelodont paraceratherium diprotodon and basilosaurus the extinction of many large reptile groups such as non avian dinosaurs plesiosauria and pterosauria allowed mammals to greatly diversify and dominate the planet even to the present day
early in the cenozoic following the k-pg event the planet was dominated by relatively small fauna including small mammals birds reptiles and amphibians from a geological perspective it did not take long for mammals and birds to greatly diversify in the absence of the large reptiles that had dominated during the mesozoic some flightless birds grew larger than the average human these species are sometimes referred to as "terror birds," and were formidable predators mammals came to occupy almost every available niche (both marine and terrestrial) and some also grew very large attaining sizes not seen in most of today's terrestrial mammals
climate-wise the earth had begun a drying and cooling trend culminating in the glaciations of the pleistocene epoch and partially offset by the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum the continents also began looking roughly familiar at this time and moved into their current positions
== subdivisions ==
the cenozoic is divided into three periods: the paleogene neogene and quaternary; and seven epochs: the paleocene eocene oligocene miocene pliocene pleistocene and holocene the quaternary period was officially recognized by the international commission on stratigraphy in june 2009 and the former tertiary period was officially disused in 2004 because of the necessity to divide the cenozoic into periods more like that of the previous paleozoic and mesozoic eras the common use of epochs during the cenozoic helps paleontologists better organize and group the many significant events that occurred during this comparatively short interval of time there is also more detailed knowledge of this era than any other because of the relatively young strata associated with it
=== paleogene ===
the paleogene spans from the extinction of the dinosaurs some 66 million years ago to the dawn of the neogene twenty three million years ago it features three epochs: the paleocene eocene and oligocene
the paleocene ranged from 65 million to 55 million years ago the paleocene is a transitional point between the devastation that is the k-t extinction to the rich jungles environment that is the early eocene the early paleocene saw the recovery of the earth the continents began to take their modern shape but all the continents and subcontinent india were separated from each other afro-eurasia was separated by the tethys sea and the americas were separated by the strait of panama as the isthmus had not yet formed this epoch featured a general warming trend with jungles eventually reaching the poles the oceans were dominated by sharks as the large reptiles that had once ruled became extinct archaic mammals filled the world such as creodonts and early primates that evolved during the mesozoic and as a result there was nothing over 10 kilograms mammals were still quite small
the eocene epoch ranged from 55 million years to 33 million years ago in the early-eocene life was small and lived in cramped jungles much like the paleocene there was nothing over the weight of 10 kilograms among them were early primates whales and horses along with many other early forms of mammals at the top of the food chains were huge birds such as gastornis it is the only time that birds ruled the world (excluding their ancestors the dinosaurs) the temperature was 30 degrees celsius with little temperature gradient from pole to pole in the mid-eocene the circum-antarctic current between australia and antarctica formed which disrupted ocean currents worldwide and as a result caused a global cooling effect shrinking the jungles this allowed mammals to grow to mammoth proportions such as whales which by that time were almost fully aquatic mammals like andrewsarchus were at the top of the food-chain and sharks were replaced by whales such as basilosaurus as rulers of the seas the late eocene saw the rebirth of seasons which caused the expansion of savanna-like areas along with the evolution of grass
the oligocene epoch spans from 33 million to 23 million years ago the oligocene featured the expansion of grass which had led to many new species to evolve including the first elephants cats dogs marsupials and many other species still prevalent today many other species of plants evolved in this period too such as the evergreen trees a cooling period was still in effect and seasonal rains were as well mammals still continued to grow larger and larger paraceratherium the largest land mammal to ever live evolved during this period along with many perissodactyls in an event known as the grande coupure
=== neogene ===
the neogene spans from 23 million to 3 million years ago and is the shortest geological period in the phanerozoic eon it features 2 epochs: the miocene and the pliocene
the miocene spans from 23 to 5 million years ago and is a period in which grass spread further across effectively dominating a large portion of the world diminishing forests in the process kelp forests evolved leading to the evolution of new species such as sea otters during this time perissodactyls thrived and evolved into many different varieties alongside them were the apes which evolved into a staggering 30 species overall arid and mountainous land dominated most of the world as did grazers the tethys sea finally closed with the creation of the arabian peninsula and in its wake left the black red mediterranean and caspian seas this only increased aridity many new plants evolved and 95% of modern seed plants evolved in the mid-miocene
the pliocene lasted from 5 to 3 million years ago the pliocene featured dramatic climactic changes which ultimately led to modern species and plants the mediterranean sea dried up for several million years along with these major geological events australopithecus evolved in africa beginning the human branch the isthmus of panama formed and animals migrated between north and south america wreaking havoc on the local ecology climatic changes brought savannas that are still continuing to spread across the world indian monsoons deserts in east asia and the beginnings of the sahara desert the earth's continents and seas moved into their present shapes the world map has not changed much since
=== quaternary ===
the quaternary spans from 3 million to present day and features modern animals and dramatic changes in the climate it is divided into two epochs: the pleistocene and the holocene
the pleistocene lasted from 3 million to 12,000 years ago this epoch was marked by ice ages as a result of the cooling trend that started in the mid-eocene there were at least four separate glaciation periods marked by the advance of ice caps as far south as 40 degrees n latitude in mountainous areas meanwhile africa experienced a trend of desiccation which resulted in the creation of the sahara namib and kalahari deserts many animals evolved including mammoths giant ground sloths dire wolves saber-toothed cats and most famously homo sapiens 100,000 years ago marked the end of one of the worst droughts of africa and led to the expansion of primitive man as the pleistocene drew to a close a major extinction wiped out much of the world's megafauna including some of the hominid species such as neanderthals all the continents were affected but africa to a lesser extent the continent retains many large animals such as hippos
the holocene began 12,000 years ago and lasts until to present day all recorded history and "the history of the world" lies within the boundaries of the holocene epoch human activity is blamed for a mass extinction that began roughly 10,000 years ago though the species becoming extinct have only been recorded since the industrial revolution this is sometimes referred to as the "sixth extinction" 322 species have become extinct due to human activity since the industrial revolution
== tectonics ==
geologically the cenozoic is the era when the continents moved into their current positions australia-new guinea having split from pangea during the early cretaceous drifted north and eventually collided with south-east asia; antarctica moved into its current position over the south pole; the atlantic ocean widened and later in the era south america became attached to north america with the isthmus of panama
india collided with asia 55 to 45 million years ago creating the himalayas; arabia collided with eurasia closing the tethys ocean and creating the zagros mountains around 35 million years ago
== climate ==
the paleoceneeocene thermal maximum of 55.8 million years ago was a significant global warming event; however since the azolla event of 49 million years ago the cenozoic era has been a period of long-term cooling after the tectonic creation of drake passage when south america fully detached from antarctica during the oligocene the climate cooled significantly due to the advent of the antarctic circumpolar current which brought cool deep antarctic water to the surface the cooling trend continued in the miocene with relatively short warmer periods when south america became attached to north america creating the isthmus of panama the arctic region cooled due to the strengthening of the humboldt and gulf stream currents eventually leading to the glaciations of the quaternary ice age the current interglacial of which is the holocene epoch recent analysis of the geomagnetic reversal frequency oxygen isotope record and tectonic plate subduction rate which are indicators of the changes in the heat flux at the core mantle boundary climate and plate tectonic activity shows that all these changes indicate similar rhythms on million years timescale in the cenozoic era occurring with the common fundamental periodicity of 13 myr during most of the time
== life ==
during the cenozoic mammals proliferated from a few small simple generalized forms into a diverse collection of terrestrial marine and flying animals giving this period its other name the age of mammals despite the fact that there are more than twice as many bird species as mammal species the cenozoic is just as much the age of savannas the age of co-dependent flowering plants and insects and the age of birds grass also played a very important role in this era shaping the evolution of the birds and mammals that fed on it one group that diversified significantly in the cenozoic as well were the snakes evolving in the cenozoic the variety of snakes increased tremendously resulting in many colubrids following the evolution of their current primary prey source the rodents
in the earlier part of the cenozoic the world was dominated by the gastornithid birds terrestrial crocodiles like pristichampsus and a handful of primitive large mammal groups like uintatheres mesonychids and pantodonts but as the forests began to recede and the climate began to cool other mammals took over
the cenozoic is full of mammals both strange and familiar including chalicotheres creodonts whales primates entelodonts saber-toothed cats mastodons and mammoths three-toed horses giant rhinoceros like indricotherium the rhinoceros-like brontotheres various bizarre groups of mammals from south america such as the vaguely elephant-like pyrotheres and the dog-like marsupial relatives called borhyaenids and the monotremes and marsupials of australia
