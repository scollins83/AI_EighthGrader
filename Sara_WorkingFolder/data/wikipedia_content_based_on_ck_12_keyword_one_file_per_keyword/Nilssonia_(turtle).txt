nilssonia is a genus of softshell turtles (family trionychidae) from rivers streams ponds and lakes in south asia and burma in many treatments it is monotypic with the single species burmese peacock softshell (n formosa) however the supposed other genus of peacock softshells aspideretes is more closely related to n formosa than had been believed they differ only in the neural plates between the first pleural scale pair of the bony carapace which are fused into one in n formosa and unfused in the others
thus it has been proposed to unite the two genera under the older name nilssonia as it seems the closest living relatives of the burmese peacock softshell are the indian softshell turtle (a./n gangeticus) and the leith's softshell turtle (a./n leithii) making the merging of the genera well warranted
== etymology ==
the generic name nilssonia is in honor of swedish zoologist sven nilsson
== species ==
if the genera are united the five species are:
nilssonia formosa (gray 1869) burmese peacock softshell burmese softshell turtle
nilssonia gangetica (cuvier 1825) indian softshell turtle ganges softshell turtle
nilssonia hurum (gray 1831) indian peacock softshell turtle
nilssonia leithii (gray 1872) leith's softshell turtle nagpur softshell turtle
nilssonia nigricans (anderson 1875) black softshell turtle bostami turtle
nota bene: a binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than nilssonia
