each seminal vesicle consists of a single tube coiled upon itself and giving off several irregular cecal diverticula; the separate coils as well as the diverticula are connected together by fibrous tissue when uncoiled the tube is about the diameter of a quill and varies in length from 10 to 15 cm.; it ends posteriorly in a cul-de-sac; its anterior extremity becomes constricted into a narrow straight duct called the excretory duct of seminal gland (or duct of the seminal vesicle) which joins with the corresponding ductus deferens to form the ejaculatory duct
