regulation of gene expression includes a wide range of mechanisms that are used by cells to increase or decrease the production of specific gene products (protein or rna) and is informally termed gene regulation sophisticated programs of gene expression are widely observed in biology for example to trigger developmental pathways respond to environmental stimuli or adapt to new food sources virtually any step of gene expression can be modulated from transcriptional initiation to rna processing and to the post-translational modification of a protein
gene regulation is essential for viruses prokaryotes and eukaryotes as it increases the versatility and adaptability of an organism by allowing the cell to express protein when needed although as early as 1951 barbara mcclintock showed interaction between two genetic loci activator (ac) and dissociator (ds) in the color formation of maize seeds the first discovery of a gene regulation system is widely considered to be the identification in 1961 of the lac operon discovered by jacques monod in which some enzymes involved in lactose metabolism are expressed by e coli only in the presence of lactose and absence of glucose
furthermore in multicellular organisms gene regulation drives the processes of cellular differentiation and morphogenesis leading to the creation of different cell types that possess different gene expression profiles and hence produce different proteins/have different ultrastructures that suit them to their functions (though they all possess the genotype which follows the same genome sequence)
the initiating event leading to a change in gene expression include activation or deactivation of receptors also there is evidence that changes in a cell's choice of catabolism leads to altered gene expressions
== regulated stages of gene expression ==
any step of gene expression may be modulated from the dna-rna transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein the following is a list of stages where gene expression is regulated the most extensively utilised point is transcription initiation:
chromatin domains
transcription
post-transcriptional modification
rna transport
translation
mrna degradation
== modification of dna ==
in eukaryotes the accessibility of large regions of dna can depend on its chromatin structure which can be altered as a result of histone modifications directed by dna methylation ncrna or dna-binding protein hence these modifications may up or down regulate the expression of a gene some of these modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and are referred to as epigenetic regulation
=== structural ===
transcription of dna is dictated by its structure in general the density of its packing is indicative of the frequency of transcription octameric protein complexes called nucleosomes are responsible for the amount of supercoiling of dna and these complexes can be temporarily modified by processes such as phosphorylation or more permanently modified by processes such as methylation such modifications are considered to be responsible for more or less permanent changes in gene expression levels
=== chemical ===
methylation of dna is a common method of gene silencing dna is typically methylated by methyltransferase enzymes on cytosine nucleotides in a cpg dinucleotide sequence (also called "cpg islands" when densely clustered) analysis of the pattern of methylation in a given region of dna (which can be a promoter) can be achieved through a method called bisulfite mapping methylated cytosine residues are unchanged by the treatment whereas unmethylated ones are changed to uracil the differences are analyzed by dna sequencing or by methods developed to quantify snps such as pyrosequencing (biotage) or massarray (sequenom) measuring the relative amounts of c/t at the cg dinucleotide abnormal methylation patterns are thought to be involved in oncogenesis
histone acetylation is also an important process in transcription histone acetyltransferase enzymes (hats) such as creb-binding protein also dissociate the dna from the histone complex allowing transcription to proceed often dna methylation and histone deacetylation work together in gene silencing the combination of the two seems to be a signal for dna to be packed more densely lowering gene expression
== regulation of transcription ==
regulation of transcription thus controls when transcription occurs and how much rna is created transcription of a gene by rna polymerase can be regulated by at least five mechanisms:
specificity factors alter the specificity of rna polymerase for a given promoter or set of promoters making it more or less likely to bind to them (i.e. sigma factors used in prokaryotic transcription)
repressors bind to the operator coding sequences on the dna strand that are close to or overlapping the promoter region impeding rna polymerase's progress along the strand thus impeding the expression of the gene.the image to the right demonstrates regulation by a repressor in the lac operon
general transcription factors position rna polymerase at the start of a protein-coding sequence and then release the polymerase to transcribe the mrna
activators enhance the interaction between rna polymerase and a particular promoter encouraging the expression of the gene activators do this by increasing the attraction of rna polymerase for the promoter through interactions with subunits of the rna polymerase or indirectly by changing the structure of the dna
enhancers are sites on the dna helix that are bound by activators in order to loop the dna bringing a specific promoter to the initiation complex enhancers are much more common in eukaryotes than prokaryotes where only a few examples exist (to date)
silencers are regions of dna sequences that when bound by particular transcription factors can silence expression of the gene
== post-transcriptional regulation ==
after the dna is transcribed and mrna is formed there must be some sort of regulation on how much the mrna is translated into proteins cells do this by modulating the capping splicing addition of a poly(a) tail the sequence-specific nuclear export rates and in several contexts sequestration of the rna transcript these processes occur in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes this modulation is a result of a protein or transcript that in turn is regulated and may have an affinity for certain sequences
== three prime untranslated regions and micrornas ==
three prime untranslated regions (3'-utrs) of messenger rnas (mrnas) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression such 3'-utrs often contain both binding sites for micrornas (mirnas) as well as for regulatory proteins by binding to specific sites within the 3'-utr mirnas can decrease gene expression of various mrnas by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript the 3'-utr also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mrna
the 3'-utr often contains mirna response elements (mres) mres are sequences to which mirnas bind these are prevalent motifs within 3'-utrs among all regulatory motifs within the 3'-utrs (e.g including silencer regions) mres make up about half of the motifs
as of 2014 the mirbase web site an archive of mirna sequences and annotations listed 28,645 entries in 233 biologic species of these 1,881 mirnas were in annotated human mirna loci mirnas were predicted to have an average of about four hundred target mrnas (affecting expression of several hundred genes) freidman et al estimate that >45,000 mirna target sites within human mrna 3'-utrs are conserved above background levels and >60% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to mirnas
direct experiments show that a single mirna can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique mrnas other experiments show that a single mirna may repress the production of hundreds of proteins but that this repression often is relatively mild (less than 2-fold)
the effects of mirna dysregulation of gene expression seem to be important in cancer for instance in gastrointestinal cancers a 2015 paper identified nine mirnas as epigenetically altered and effective in down-regulating dna repair enzymes
the effects of mirna dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia bipolar disorder major depressive disorder parkinson's disease alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorders
== regulation of translation ==
the translation of mrna can also be controlled by a number of mechanisms mostly at the level of initiation recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit can indeed be modulated by mrna secondary structure antisense rna binding or protein binding in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes a large number of rna binding proteins exist which often are directed to their target sequence by the secondary structure of the transcript which may change depending on certain conditions such as temperature or presence of a ligand (aptamer) some transcripts act as ribozymes and self-regulate their expression
== examples of gene regulation ==
enzyme induction is a process in which a molecule (e.g. a drug) induces (i.e. initiates or enhances) the expression of an enzyme
the induction of heat shock proteins in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster
the lac operon is an interesting example of how gene expression can be regulated
viruses despite having only a few genes possess mechanisms to regulate their gene expression typically into an early and late phase using collinear systems regulated by anti-terminators (lambda phage) or splicing modulators (hiv)
gal4 is a transcriptional activator that controls the expression of gal1 gal7 and gal10 (all of which code for the metabolic of galactose in yeast) the gal4/uas system has been used in a variety of organisms across various phyla to study gene expression
=== developmental biology ===
a large number of studied regulatory systems come from developmental biology examples include:
the colinearity of the hox gene cluster with their nested antero-posterior patterning
it has been speculated that pattern generation of the hand (digits - interdigits) the gradient of sonic hedgehog (secreted inducing factor) from the zone of polarizing activity in the limb which creates a gradient of active gli3 which activates gremlin which inhibits bmps also secreted in the limb resulting in the formation of an alternating pattern of activity as a result of this reaction-diffusion system
somitogenesis is the creation of segments (somites) from a uniform tissue (pre-somitic mesoderm psm) they are formed sequentially from anterior to posterior this is achieved in amniotes possibly by means of two opposing gradients retinoic acid in the anterior (wavefront) and wnt and fgf in the posterior coupled to an oscillating pattern (segmentation clock) composed of fgf + notch and wnt in antiphase
sex determination in the soma of a drosophila requires the sensing of the ratio of autosomal genes to sex chromosome-encoded genes which results in the production of sexless splicing factor in females resulting in the female isoform of doublesex
== circuitry ==
=== up-regulation and down-regulation ===
up-regulation is a process that occurs within a cell triggered by a signal (originating internal or external to the cell) which results in increased expression of one or more genes and as a result the protein(s) encoded by those genes on the converse down-regulation is a process resulting in decreased gene and corresponding protein expression
up-regulation occurs for example when a cell is deficient in some kind of receptor in this case more receptor protein is synthesized and transported to the membrane of the cell and thus the sensitivity of the cell is brought back to normal reestablishing homeostasis
down-regulation occurs for example when a cell is overstimulated by a neurotransmitter hormone or drug for a prolonged period of time and the expression of the receptor protein is decreased in order to protect the cell (see also tachyphylaxis)
=== inducible vs repressible systems ===
gene regulation can be summarized by the response of the respective system:
inducible systems - an inducible system is off unless there is the presence of some molecule (called an inducer) that allows for gene expression the molecule is said to "induce expression" the manner by which this happens is dependent on the control mechanisms as well as differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
repressible systems - a repressible system is on except in the presence of some molecule (called a corepressor) that suppresses gene expression the molecule is said to "repress expression" the manner by which this happens is dependent on the control mechanisms as well as differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
the gal4/uas system is an example of both an inducible and repressible system gal4 binds an upstream activation sequence (uas) to activate the transcription of the gal1/gal7/gal10 cassette on the other hand a mig1 response to the presence of glucose can inhibit gal4 and therefore stop the expression of the gal1/gal7/gal10 cassette
=== theoretical circuits ===
repressor/inducer: an activation of a sensor results in the change of expression of a gene
negative feedback: the gene product downregulates its own production directly or indirectly which can result in
keeping transcript levels constant/proportional to a factor
inhibition of run-away reactions when coupled with a positive feedback loop
creating an oscillator by taking advantage in the time delay of transcription and translation given that the mrna and protein half-life is shorter
positive feedback: the gene product upregulates its own production directly or indirectly which can result in
signal amplification
bistable switches when two genes inhibit each other and both have positive feedback
pattern generation
== study methods ==
in general most experiments investigating differential expression used whole cell extracts of rna called steady-state levels to determine which genes changed and by how much they did these are however not informative of where the regulation has occurred and may actually mask conflicting regulatory processes (see post-transcriptional regulation) but it is still the most commonly analysed (quantitative pcr and dna microarray)
when studying gene expression there are several methods to look at the various stages in eukaryotes these include:
the local chromatin environment of the region can be determined by chip-chip analysis by pulling down rna polymerase ii histone 3 modifications trithorax-group protein polycomb-group protein or any other dna-binding element to which a good antibody is available
epistatic interactions can be investigated by synthetic genetic array analysis
due to post-transcriptional regulation transcription rates and total rna levels differ significantly to measure the transcription rates nuclear run-on assays can be done and newer high-throughput methods are being developed using thiol labelling instead of radioactivity
only 5% of the rna polymerised in the nucleus actually exits and not only introns abortive products and non-sense transcripts are degradated therefore the differences in nuclear and cytoplasmic levels can be see by separating the two fractions by gentle lysis
alternative splicing can be analysed with a splicing array or with a tiling array (see dna microarray)
all in vivo rna is complexed as rnps the quantity of transcripts bound to specific protein can be also analysed by rip-chip for example dcp2 will give an indication of sequestered protein; ribosome-bound gives and indication of transcripts active in transcription (although it should be noted that a more dated method called polysome fractionation is still popular in some labs)
protein levels can be analysed by mass spectrometry which can be compared only to quantitative pcr data as microarray data is relative and not absolute
rna and protein degradation rates are measured by means of transcription inhibitors (actinomycin d or -amanitin) or translation inhibitors (cycloheximide) respectively
