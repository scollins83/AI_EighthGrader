a turn is a unit of plane angle measurement equal to 2 radians 360 or 400 gon a turn is also referred to as a revolution or complete rotation or full circle or cycle or rev or rot
a turn can be subdivided in many different ways: into half turns quarter turns centiturns milliturns binary angles points etc
== subdivision of turnsedit ==
a turn can be divided in 100 centiturns or 1000 milliturns with each milliturn corresponding to an angle of 0.36 which can also be written as 2136 a protractor divided in centiturns is normally called a percentage protractor
binary fractions of a turn are also used sailors have traditionally divided a turn into 32 compass points the binary degree also known as the binary radian (or brad) is 1256 turn the binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be represented to the maximum possible precision in a single byte other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2n equal parts for other values of n
the notion of turn is commonly used for planar rotations two special rotations have acquired appellations of their own: a rotation through 180 is commonly referred to as a half-turn ( radians) a rotation through 90 is referred to as a quarter-turn a half-turn is sometimes referred to as a reflection in a point since these are identical for transformations in two-dimensions
== historyedit ==
the word turn originates via latin and french from the greek word (tornos a lathe)
in 1697 david gregory used / (pi over rho) to denote the perimeter of a circle (i.e. the circumference) divided by its radius however earlier in 1647 william oughtred had used / (delta over pi) for the ratio of the diameter to perimeter the first use of the symbol on its own with its present meaning (of perimeter divided by diameter) was in 1706 by the welsh mathematician william jones euler adopted the symbol with that meaning in 1737 leading to its widespread use
percentage protractors have existed since 1922 but the terms centiturns and milliturns were introduced much later by sir fred hoyle
the german standard din 1315 (1974-03) proposed the unit symbol pla (from latin: plenus angulus "full angle") for turns since 2011 the hp 39gii and hp prime support the unit symbol tr for turns
== mathematical constantsedit ==
one turn is equal to 2 (6.283185307179586) radians
== tau proposaledit ==
in 2001 robert palais proposed using the number of radians in a turn as the fundamental circle constant instead of  which amounts to the number of radians in half a turn in order to make mathematics simpler and more intuitive using a "pi with three legs" symbol to denote the constant ( = 2)
in 2010 michael hartl proposed to use the greek letter (tau) instead for two reasons first is the radian angle measure for one turn of a circle which allows fractions of a turn to be expressed such as 2/5 for a 2/5 turn or 4/5 second visually resembles  whose association with the circle constant is unavoidable hartl's tau manifesto gives many examples of formulas that are simpler if tau is used instead of pi
== examples of useedit ==
as an angular unit the turn or revolution is particularly useful for large angles such as in connection with electromagnetic coils and rotating objects see also winding number
the angular speed of rotating machinery such as automobile engines is commonly measured in revolutions per minute or rpm
turn is used in complex dynamics for measure of external and internal angles the sum of external angles of a polygon equals one turn angle doubling map is used
pie charts illustrate proportions of a whole as fractions of a turn each one percent is shown as an angle of one centiturn
== kinematics of turnsedit ==
in kinematics a turn is a rotation less than a full revolution a turn may be represented in a mathematical model that uses expressions of complex numbers or quaternions in the complex plane every non-zero number has a polar coordinate expression z = r cos a + ri sin a where r > 0 and a is in [0 2) a turn of the complex plane arises from multiplying z = x + iy by an element u = ebi that lies on the unit circle:
z uz
frank morley consistently referred to elements of the unit circle as turns in the book inversive geometry (1933) that he coauthored with his son frank vigor morley
the latin term for turn is versor which is a quaternion that can be visualized as an arc of a great circle the product of two versors can be compared to a spherical triangle where two sides add to the third for the kinematics of rotation in three dimensions see quaternions and spatial rotation
