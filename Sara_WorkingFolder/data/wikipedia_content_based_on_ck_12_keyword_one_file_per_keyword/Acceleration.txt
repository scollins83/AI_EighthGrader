acceleration in physics is the rate of change of velocity of an object an object's acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object as described by newton's second law the si unit for acceleration is metre per second squared (m/s2) accelerations are vector quantities (they have magnitude and direction) and add according to the parallelogram law as a vector the calculated net force is equal to the product of the object's mass (a scalar quantity) and the acceleration
for example when a car starts from a standstill (zero relative velocity) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds it is accelerating in the direction of travel if the car turns there is an acceleration toward the new direction for this example we can call the accelerating of the car forward a "linear acceleration" which passengers in the car might experience as force pushing them back into their seats when changing directions we might call this "non-linear acceleration" which passengers might experience as a sideways force if the speed of the car decreases this is an acceleration in the opposite direction of the direction of the vehicle sometimes called deceleration passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them away from their seats mathematically there is no separate formula for deceleration as both are changes in velocity each of these accelerations (linear non-linear deceleration) might be felt by passengers until their velocity (speed and direction) match that of the car
== definition and properties ==
=== average acceleration ===
an object's average acceleration over a period of time is its change in velocity divided by the duration of the period  mathematically
=== instantaneous acceleration ===
instantaneous acceleration meanwhile is the limit of the average acceleration over an infinitesimal interval of time in the terms of calculus instantaneous acceleration is the derivative of the velocity vector with respect to time:
(here and elsewhere if motion is in a straight line vector quantities can be substituted by scalars in the equations.)
it can be seen that the integral of the acceleration function a(t) is the velocity function v(t); that is the area under the curve of an acceleration vs time (a vs t) graph corresponds to velocity
given the fact that acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity v with respect to time t and velocity is defined as the derivative of position x with respect to time acceleration can be thought of as the second derivative of x with respect to t:
=== units ===
acceleration has the dimensions of velocity (l/t) divided by time i.e. l/t2 the si unit of acceleration is the metre per second squared (m/s2); this can be called more meaningfully "metre per second per second" as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value every second
=== other forms ===
an object moving in a circular motionsuch as a satellite orbiting the earthis accelerating due to the change of direction of motion although the magnitude (speed) may be constant when an object is executing such a motion where it changes direction but not speed it is said to be undergoing centripetal (directed towards the center) acceleration oppositely a change in the speed of an object but not its direction of motion is a tangential acceleration
proper acceleration the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition is measured by an instrument called an accelerometer
in classical mechanics for a body with constant mass the (vector) acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net force vector (i.e. sum of all forces) acting on it (newton's second law):
where f is the net force acting on the body m is the mass of the body and a is the center-of-mass acceleration as speeds approach the speed of light relativistic effects become increasingly large and acceleration becomes less
== tangential and centripetal acceleration ==
the velocity of a particle moving on a curved path as a function of time can be written as:
with v(t) equal to the speed of travel along the path and
a unit vector tangent to the path pointing in the direction of motion at the chosen moment in time taking into account both the changing speed v(t) and the changing direction of ut the acceleration of a particle moving on a curved path can be written using the chain rule of differentiation for the product of two functions of time as:
where un is the unit (inward) normal vector to the particle's trajectory (also called the principal normal) and r is its instantaneous radius of curvature based upon the osculating circle at time t these components are called the tangential acceleration and the normal or radial acceleration (or centripetal acceleration in circular motion see also circular motion and centripetal force)
geometrical analysis of three-dimensional space curves which explains tangent (principal) normal and binormal is described by the frenetserret formulas
== special cases ==
=== uniform acceleration ===
uniform or constant acceleration is a type of motion in which the velocity of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period
a frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in free fall in a uniform gravitational field the acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the gravitational field strength g (also called acceleration due to gravity) by newton's second law the force f acting on a body is given by:
due to the simple algebraic properties of constant acceleration in the one-dimensional case (that is the case of acceleration aligned with the initial velocity) there are simple formulas relating the quantities displacement s initial velocity v0 final velocity v acceleration a and time t:
where
= displacement
= initial velocity
= final velocity
= uniform acceleration
= time
in the case of uniform acceleration of an object that is initially moving in a direction not aligned with the acceleration the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts one of constant velocity and the other according to the above equations as galileo showed the net result is parabolic motion as in the trajectory of a cannonball neglecting air resistance
=== circular motion ===
uniform circular motion that is constant speed along a circular path is an example of a body experiencing acceleration resulting in velocity of a constant magnitude but change of direction in this case because the direction of the object's motion is constantly changing being tangential to the circle the object's linear velocity vector also changes but its speed does not this acceleration is a radial acceleration since it is always directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the magnitude:
where is the object's linear speed along the circular path equivalently the radial acceleration vector () may be calculated from the object's angular velocity :
where is a vector directed from the centre of the circle and equal in magnitude to the radius the negative shows that the acceleration vector is directed towards the centre of the circle (opposite to the radius)
the acceleration and the net force acting on a body in uniform circular motion are directed toward the centre of the circle; that is it is centripetal whereas the so-called 'centrifugal force' appearing to act outward on the body is really a pseudo force experienced in the frame of reference of the body in circular motion due to the body's linear momentum at a tangent to the circle
with nonuniform circular motion i.e. the speed along the curved path changes a transverse acceleration is produced equal to the rate of change of the angular speed around the circle times the radius of the circle that is
the transverse (or tangential) acceleration is directed at right angles to the radius vector and takes the sign of the angular acceleration ()
== relation to relativity ==
=== special relativity ===
the special theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects traveling relative to other objects at speeds approaching that of light in a vacuum newtonian mechanics is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality valid to great accuracy at lower speeds as the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light acceleration no longer follows classical equations
as speeds approach that of light the acceleration produced by a given force decreases becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an object with mass can approach this speed asymptotically but never reach it
=== general relativity ===
unless the state of motion of an object is known it is totally impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to gravity or to accelerationgravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects albert einstein called this the principle of equivalence and said that only observers who feel no force at allincluding the force of gravityare justified in concluding that they are not accelerating
