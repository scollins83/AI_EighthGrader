an organic compound is any member of a large class of gaseous liquid or solid chemical compounds whose molecules contain carbon for historical reasons discussed below a few types of carbon-containing compounds such as carbides carbonates simple oxides of carbon (such as co and co2) and cyanides are considered inorganic the distinction between organic and inorganic carbon compounds while "useful in organizing the vast subject of chemistry is somewhat arbitrary"
organic chemistry is the science concerned with all aspects of organic compounds organic synthesis is the methodology of their preparation
== historyedit ==
=== vitalismedit ===
the word organic is historical dating to the 1st century for many centuries western alchemists believed in vitalism this is the theory that certain compounds could be synthesized only from their classical elementsearth water air and fireby the action of a "life-force" (vis vitalis) that only organisms possessed vitalism taught that these "organic" compounds were fundamentally different from the "inorganic" compounds that could be obtained from the elements by chemical manipulation
vitalism survived for a while even after the rise of modern atomic theory and the replacement of the aristotelian elements by those we know today it first came under question in 1824 when friedrich whler synthesized oxalic acid a compound known to occur only in living organisms from cyanogen a more decisive experiment was whler's 1828 synthesis of urea from the inorganic salts potassium cyanate and ammonium sulfate urea had long been considered an "organic" compound as it was known to occur only in the urine of living organisms whler's experiments were followed by many others where increasingly complex "organic" substances were produced from "inorganic" ones without the involvement of any living organism
=== modern classificationedit ===
even though vitalism has been discredited scientific nomenclature retains the distinction between organic and inorganic compounds the modern meaning of organic compound is any compound that contains a significant amount of carboneven though many of the organic compounds known today have no connection to any substance found in living organisms
there is no single "official" definition of an organic compound some textbooks define an organic compound as one that contains one or more c-h bonds others include c-c bonds in the definition others state that if a molecule contains carbonit is organic
even the broader definition of "carbon-containing molecules" requires the exclusion of carbon-containing alloys (including steel) a relatively small number of carbon-containing compounds such as metal carbonates and carbonyls simple oxides of carbon and cyanides as well as the allotropes of carbon and simple carbon halides and sulfides which are usually considered inorganic
the "c-h" definition excludes compounds that are historically and practically considered organic neither urea nor oxalic acid is organic by this definition yet they were two key compounds in the vitalism debate the iupac blue book on organic nomenclature specifically mentions urea and oxalic acid other compounds lacking c-h bonds that are also traditionally considered organic include benzenehexol mesoxalic acid and carbon tetrachloride mellitic acid which contains no c-h bonds is considered a possible organic substance in martian soil c-c bonds are found in most organic compounds except some small molecules like methane and methanol which have only one carbon atom in their structure
the "c-h bond-only" rule also leads to somewhat arbitrary divisions in sets of carbon-fluorine compounds as for example teflon is considered by this rule to be "inorganic" whereas tefzel is considered to be organic likewise many halons are considered inorganic whereas the rest are considered organic for these and other reasons most sources believe that c-h compounds are only a subset of "organic" compounds
in summary most carbon-containing compounds are organic and almost all organic compounds contain at least a c-h bond or a c-c bond a compound does not need to contain c-h bonds to be considered organic (e.g. urea) but many organic compounds do
== classificationedit ==
organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways one major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms e.g. organometallic compounds which feature bonds between carbon and a metal and organophosphorus compounds which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus
another distinction based on the size of organic compounds distinguishes between small molecules and polymers
=== natural compoundsedit ===
natural compounds refer to those that are produced by plants or animals many of these are still extracted from natural sources because they would be more expensive to produce artificially examples include most sugars some alkaloids and terpenoids certain nutrients such as vitamin b12 and in general those natural products with large or stereoisometrically complicated molecules present in reasonable concentrations in living organisms
further compounds of prime importance in biochemistry are antigens carbohydrates enzymes hormones lipids and fatty acids neurotransmitters nucleic acids proteins peptides and amino acids lectins vitamins and fats and oils
=== synthetic compoundsedit ===
compounds that are prepared by reaction of other compounds are known as "synthetic" they may be either compounds that already are found in plants or animals or those that do not occur naturally
most polymers (a category that includes all plastics and rubbers) are organic synthetic or semi-synthetic compounds
=== biotechnologyedit ===
several compounds are industrially manufactured utilizing the biochemistry of organisms such as bacteria and yeast two examples are ethanol and insulin regularly the dna of the organism is altered to express desired compounds that are often not ordinarily produced by that organism sometimes the biotechnologically engineered compounds were never present in nature in the first place
== nomenclatureedit ==
the iupac nomenclature of organic compounds slightly differs from the cas nomenclature
== databasesedit ==
the cas database is the most comprehensive repository for data on organic compounds the search tool scifinder is offered
the beilstein database contains information on 9.8 million substances covers the scientific literature from 1771 to the present and is today accessible via reaxys structures and a large diversity of physical and chemical properties is available for each substance with reference to original literature
pubchem contains 18.4 million entries on compounds and especially covers the field of medicinal chemistry
there is a great number of more specialized databases for diverse branches of organic chemistry
== structure determinationedit ==
see structure determination
today the main tools are proton and carbon-13 nmr spectroscopy ir spectroscopy mass spectrometry uv/vis spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography
