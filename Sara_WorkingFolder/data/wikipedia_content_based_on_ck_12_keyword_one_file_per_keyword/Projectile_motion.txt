projectile motion is a form of motion in which an object or particle (called a projectile) is thrown near the earth's surface and it moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only the only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity which acts downward to cause a downward acceleration because of the object's inertia no external horizontal force is needed to maintain the horizontal motion
== the initial velocity ==
let the projectile be launched with an initial velocity  which can be expressed as the sum of horizontal and vertical components as follows:
the components and can be found if the angle is known:
if the projectile's range (r) launch angle ( or ) and drop height (h) are known launch speed can be found using newton's formula:
== kinematic quantities of projectile motion ==
in projectile motion the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is neither motion affects the other this is the principle of compound motion established by galileo in 1638
=== acceleration ===
since there is only acceleration in the vertical direction the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant being equal to  the vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall here the acceleration is constant being equal to  the components of the acceleration are:
=== velocity ===
the horizontal component of the velocity of the object remains unchanged throughout the motion the downward vertical component of the velocity increases linearly because the acceleration due to gravity is constant the accelerations in the and directions can be integrated to solve for the components of velocity at any time  as follows:
the magnitude of the velocity (under the pythagorean theorem also known as the triangle law):
=== displacement ===
at any time  the projectile's horizontal and vertical displacement are:
the magnitude of the displacement is:
== parabolic equation ==
consider the equations
if t is eliminated between these two equations the following equation is obtained:
this equation is the equation of a parabola since   and are constants the above equation is of the form
in which and are constants this is the equation of a parabola so the path is parabolic the axis of the parabola is vertical
== time of flight or total time of the whole journey ==
the total time for which the projectile remains in the air is called the time of flight
after the flight the projectile returns to the horizontal axis so y=0
note that we have neglected air resistance on the projectile
== maximum height of projectile ==
the greatest height that the object will reach is known as the peak of the object's motion the increase in height will last until  that is
time to reach the maximum height:
from the vertical displacement of the maximum height of projectile:
== relation between horizontal range and maximum height ==
the relation between the range on the horizontal plane and the maximum height reached at is:
=== proof ===
== maximum distance of projectile ==
it is important to note that the range and the maximum height of the projectile do not depend upon its mass hence range and maximum height are equal for all bodies that are thrown with the same velocity and direction
the horizontal range d of the projectile is the horizontal distance it has travelled when it returns to its initial height (y = 0)
time to reach ground:
from the horizontal displacement the maximum distance of projectile:
so
note that has its maximum value when
which necessarily corresponds to
or
== application of the work energy theorem ==
according to the work-energy theorem the vertical component of velocity is:
