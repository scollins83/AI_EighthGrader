a retort stand sometimes called a ring stand is a piece of scientific equipment to which clamps can be attached to hold test tubes and other equipment such as burettes which are most often used in titration experiments
it is used for carrying out distillation experiments which includes distillation of acids
it is also used in filtering
the stands are usually made of a chemically impervious metal and may be covered with aluminium foil to further protect the base on which may sit a hot plate magnetic stirrer heating mantle or some other apparatus
the rod itself to which clamps may be attached with bosses is typically 0.5 m high and is therefore sufficient for most experiments and to fit inside fume hoods and glove boxes if a taller rod is required the solid base is usually replaced by three metal legs for stability when supporting larger apparatus such as extremely large tubes bulk chemical bottles etc the height can be adjusted by moving the attached point of the stand and the test tube
