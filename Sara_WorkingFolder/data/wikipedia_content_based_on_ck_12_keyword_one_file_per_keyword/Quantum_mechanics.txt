quantum mechanics (qm; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory) including quantum field theory is a fundamental branch of physics concerned with processes involving for example atoms and photons in such processes said to be quantized the action has been observed to be only in integer multiples of the planck constant a physical quantity that is exceedingly indeed perhaps ultimately small this is utterly inexplicable in classical physics
quantum mechanics gradually arose from max planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem (reported 1859) and albert einstein's 1905 paper which offered a quantum-based theory to explain the photoelectric effect (reported 1887) early quantum theory was significantly reformulated in the mid-1920s
the mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract a mathematical function the wave function provides information about the probability amplitude of position momentum and other physical properties of a particle
important applications of quantum mechanical theory include superconducting magnets light-emitting diodes and the laser the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy and explanations for many biological and physical phenomena
== history ==
scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th centuries when scientists such as robert hooke christiaan huygens and leonhard euler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations in 1803 thomas young an english polymath performed the famous double-slit experiment that he later described in a paper entitled on the nature of light and colours this experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light
in 1838 michael faraday discovered cathode rays these studies were followed by the 1859 statement of the black-body radiation problem by gustav kirchhoff the 1877 suggestion by ludwig boltzmann that the energy states of a physical system can be discrete and the 1900 quantum hypothesis of max planck planck's hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete "quanta" (or energy elements) precisely matched the observed patterns of black-body radiation
in 1896 wilhelm wien empirically determined a distribution law of black-body radiation known as wien's law in his honor ludwig boltzmann independently arrived at this result by considerations of maxwell's equations however it was valid only at high frequencies and underestimated the radiance at low frequencies later planck corrected this model using boltzmann's statistical interpretation of thermodynamics and proposed what is now called planck's law which led to the development of quantum mechanics
following max planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem (reported 1859) albert einstein offered a quantum-based theory to explain the photoelectric effect (1905 reported 1887) around 1900-1910 the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation respectively
among the first to study quantum phenomena in nature were arthur compton c v raman and pieter zeeman each of whom has a quantum effect named after him robert andrews millikan studied the photoelectric effect experimentally and albert einstein developed a theory for it at the same time niels bohr developed his theory of the atomic structure which was later confirmed by the experiments of henry moseley in 1913 peter debye extended niels bohr's theory of atomic structure introducing elliptical orbits a concept also introduced by arnold sommerfeld this phase is known as old quantum theory
according to planck each energy element (e) is proportional to its frequency ():
where h is planck's constant
planck cautiously insisted that this was simply an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and had nothing to do with the physical reality of the radiation itself in fact he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable discovery however in 1905 albert einstein interpreted planck's quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material he won the 1921 nobel prize in physics for this work
einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could also be described as a particle (later called the photon) with a discrete quantum of energy that was dependent on its frequency
the foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the 20th century by max planck niels bohr werner heisenberg louis de broglie arthur compton albert einstein erwin schrdinger max born john von neumann paul dirac enrico fermi wolfgang pauli max von laue freeman dyson david hilbert wilhelm wien satyendra nath bose arnold sommerfeld and others the copenhagen interpretation of niels bohr became widely accepted
in the mid-1920s developments in quantum mechanics led to its becoming the standard formulation for atomic physics in the summer of 1925 bohr and heisenberg published results that closed the old quantum theory out of deference to their particle-like behavior in certain processes and measurements light quanta came to be called photons (1926) from einstein's simple postulation was born a flurry of debating theorizing and testing thus the entire field of quantum physics emerged leading to its wider acceptance at the fifth solvay conference in 1927
it was found that subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves are neither simply particle nor wave but have certain properties of each this originated the concept of waveparticle duality
by 1930 quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the work of david hilbert paul dirac and john von neumann with greater emphasis on measurement the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality and philosophical speculation about the 'observer' it has since permeated many disciplines including quantum chemistry quantum electronics quantum optics and quantum information science its speculative modern developments include string theory and quantum gravity theories it also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductors and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies
while quantum mechanics was constructed to describe the world of the very small it is also needed to explain some macroscopic phenomena such as superconductors and superfluids
the word quantum derives from the latin meaning "how great" or "how much" in quantum mechanics it refers to a discrete unit assigned to certain physical quantities such as the energy of an atom at rest (see figure 1) the discovery that particles are discrete packets of energy with wave-like properties led to the branch of physics dealing with atomic and subatomic systems which is today called quantum mechanics it underlies the mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry including condensed matter physics solid-state physics atomic physics molecular physics computational physics computational chemistry quantum chemistry particle physics nuclear chemistry and nuclear physics some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied
quantum mechanics is essential to understanding the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller if the physical nature of an atom was solely described by classical mechanics electrons would not orbit the nucleus since orbiting electrons emit radiation (due to circular motion) and would eventually collide with the nucleus due to this loss of energy this framework was unable to explain the stability of atoms instead electrons remain in an uncertain non-deterministic smeared probabilistic waveparticle orbital about the nucleus defying the traditional assumptions of classical mechanics and electromagnetism
quantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation and description of the atom especially the differences in the spectra of light emitted by different isotopes of the same chemical element as well as subatomic particles in short the quantum-mechanical atomic model has succeeded spectacularly in the realm where classical mechanics and electromagnetism falter
broadly speaking quantum mechanics incorporates four classes of phenomena for which classical physics cannot account:
quantization of certain physical properties
quantum entanglement
principle of uncertainty
waveparticle duality
== mathematical formulations ==
in the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics developed by paul dirac david hilbert john von neumann and hermann weyl the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors (called state vectors) formally these reside in a complex separable hilbert spacevariously called the state space or the associated hilbert space of the systemthat is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor) in other words the possible states are points in the projective space of a hilbert space usually called the complex projective space the exact nature of this hilbert space is dependent on the systemfor example the state space for position and momentum states is the space of square-integrable functions while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes each observable is represented by a maximally hermitian (precisely: by a self-adjoint) linear operator acting on the state space each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate if the operator's spectrum is discrete the observable can attain only those discrete eigenvalues
in the formalism of quantum mechanics the state of a system at a given time is described by a complex wave function also referred to as state vector in a complex vector space this abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of probabilities of outcomes of concrete experiments for example it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time contrary to classical mechanics one can never make simultaneous predictions of conjugate variables such as position and momentum with accuracy for instance electrons may be considered (to a certain probability) to be located somewhere within a given region of space but with their exact positions unknown contours of constant probability often referred to as "clouds" may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability heisenberg's uncertainty principle quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum
according to one interpretation as the result of a measurement the wave function containing the probability information for a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate the possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observablewhich explains the choice of hermitian operators for which all the eigenvalues are real the probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator heisenberg's uncertainty principle is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not commute
the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement this is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand it was the central topic in the famous bohreinstein debates in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments in the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics the question of what constitutes a "measurement" has been extensively studied newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of "wave function collapse" (see for example the relative state interpretation) the basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus their respective wave functions become entangled so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity for details see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics
generally quantum mechanics does not assign definite values instead it makes a prediction using a probability distribution; that is it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable often these results are skewed by many causes such as dense probability clouds probability clouds are approximate (but better than the bohr model) whereby electron location is given by a probability function the wave function eigenvalue such that the probability is the squared modulus of the complex amplitude or quantum state nuclear attraction naturally these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the "instant" of the measurement hence uncertainty is involved in the value there are however certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable these are known as eigenstates of the observable ("eigen" can be translated from german as meaning "inherent" or "characteristic")
in the everyday world it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate everything appears to have a definite position a definite momentum a definite energy and a definite time of occurrence however quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are conjugate pairs) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs); rather it provides only a range of probabilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability therefore it is helpful to use different words to describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values (eigenstates) usually a system will not be in an eigenstate of the observable (particle) we are interested in however if one measures the observable the wave function will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or "generalized" eigenstate) of that observable this process is known as wave function collapse a controversial and much-debated process that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device if one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement one will be able to compute the probability of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates for example the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave function that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x0 (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum) when one measures the position of the particle it is impossible to predict with certainty the result it is probable but not certain that it will be near x0 where the amplitude of the wave function is large after the measurement is performed having obtained some result x the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x
the time evolution of a quantum state is described by the schrdinger equation in which the hamiltonian (the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system) generates the time evolution the time evolution of wave functions is deterministic in the sense that - given a wave function at an initial time - it makes a definite prediction of what the wave function will be at any later time
during a measurement on the other hand the change of the initial wave function into another later wave function is not deterministic it is unpredictable (i.e. random) a time-evolution simulation can be seen here
wave functions change as time progresses the schrdinger equation describes how wave functions change in time playing a role similar to newton's second law in classical mechanics the schrdinger equation applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it) however the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time this also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite certain) position eigenstate
some wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant or independent of timesuch as when in a stationary state of constant energy time vanishes in the absolute square of the wave function many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such "static" wave functions for example a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by a static spherically symmetric wave function surrounding the nucleus (fig 1) (note however that only the lowest angular momentum states labeled s are spherically symmetric)
the schrdinger equation acts on the entire probability amplitude not merely its absolute value whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude encodes information about probabilities its phase encodes information about the interference between quantum states this gives rise to the "wave-like" behavior of quantum states as it turns out analytic solutions of the schrdinger equation are available for only a very small number of relatively simple model hamiltonians of which the quantum harmonic oscillator the particle in a box the dihydrogen cation and the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives even the helium atomwhich contains just one more electron than does the hydrogen atomhas defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment
there exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions however in the important method known as perturbation theory one uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate a result for a more complicated model that is related to the simpler model by (for one example) the addition of a weak potential energy another method is the "semi-classical equation of motion" approach which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only weak (small) deviations from classical behavior these deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion this approach is particularly important in the field of quantum chaos
== mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics ==
there are numerous mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics one of the oldest and most commonly used formulations is the "transformation theory" proposed by paul dirac which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics - matrix mechanics (invented by werner heisenberg) and wave mechanics (invented by erwin schrdinger)
especially since werner heisenberg was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics the role of max born in the development of qm was overlooked until the 1954 nobel award the role is noted in a 2005 biography of born which recounts his role in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics and the use of probability amplitudes heisenberg himself acknowledges having learned matrices from born as published in a 1940 festschrift honoring max planck in the matrix formulation the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its measurable properties or "observables" examples of observables include energy position momentum and angular momentum observables can be either continuous (e.g. the position of a particle) or discrete (e.g. the energy of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom) an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is feynman's path integral formulation in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over all possible classical and non-classical paths between the initial and final states this is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the action principle in classical mechanics
== interactions with other scientific theories ==
the rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental they assert that the state space of a system is a hilbert space and that observables of that system are hermitian operators acting on that spacealthough they do not tell us which hilbert space or which operators these can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system an important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or equivalently larger quantum numbers i.e whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and at the high energy limit the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero in other words classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems this "high energy" limit is known as the classical or correspondence limit one can even start from an established classical model of a particular system then attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit
when quantum mechanics was originally formulated it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanics for instance the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator
early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the schrdinger equation with a covariant equation such as the kleingordon equation or the dirac equation while these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles a fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles) the first complete quantum field theory quantum electrodynamics provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction the full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems a simpler approach one that has been employed since the inception of quantum mechanics is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field for example the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical coulomb potential this "semi-classical" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role such as in the emission of photons by charged particles
quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified in their quantized forms into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory) by the physicists abdus salam sheldon glashow and steven weinberg these three men shared the nobel prize in physics in 1979 for this work
it has proven difficult to construct quantum models of gravity the remaining fundamental force semi-classical approximations are workable and have led to predictions such as hawking radiation however the formulation of a complete theory of quantum gravity is hindered by apparent incompatibilities between general relativity (the most accurate theory of gravity currently known) and some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory the resolution of these incompatibilities is an area of active research and theories such as string theory are among the possible candidates for a future theory of quantum gravity
classical mechanics has also been extended into the complex domain with complex classical mechanics exhibiting behaviors similar to quantum mechanics
=== quantum mechanics and classical physics ===
predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy according to the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics all objects obey the laws of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics is just an approximation for large systems of objects (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles) the laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers however chaotic systems do not have good quantum numbers and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems
quantum coherence is an essential difference between classical and quantum theories as illustrated by the einsteinpodolskyrosen (epr) paradox an attack on a certain philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics by an appeal to local realism quantum interference involves adding together probability amplitudes whereas classical "waves" infer that there is an adding together of intensities for microscopic bodies the extension of the system is much smaller than the coherence length which gives rise to long-range entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena characteristic of quantum systems quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales though an exception to this rule may occur at extremely low temperatures (i.e approaching absolute zero) at which quantum behavior may manifest itself macroscopically this is in accordance with the following observations:
many macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts for example the stability of bulk matter (consisting of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone) the rigidity of solids and the mechanical thermal chemical optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics
while the seemingly "exotic" behavior of matter posited by quantum mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with particles of extremely small size or velocities approaching the speed of light the laws of classical often considered "newtonian" physics remain accurate in predicting the behavior of the vast majority of "large" objects (on the order of the size of large molecules or bigger) at velocities much smaller than the velocity of light
=== copenhagen interpretation of quantum versus classical kinematics ===
a big difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that they use very different kinematic descriptions
in niels bohr's mature view quantum mechanical phenomena are required to be experiments with complete descriptions of all the devices for the system preparative intermediary and finally measuring the descriptions are in macroscopic terms expressed in ordinary language supplemented with the concepts of classical mechanics the initial condition and the final condition of the system are respectively described by values in a configuration space for example a position space or some equivalent space such as a momentum space quantum mechanics does not admit a completely precise description in terms of both position and momentum of an initial condition or "state" (in the classical sense of the word) that would support a precisely deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition in this sense advocated by bohr in his mature writings a quantum phenomenon is a process a passage from initial to final condition not an instantaneous "state" in the classical sense of that word thus there are two kinds of processes in quantum mechanics: stationary and transitional for a stationary process the initial and final condition are the same for a transition they are different obviously by definition if only the initial condition is given the process is not determined given its initial condition prediction of its final condition is possible causally but only probabilistically because the schrdinger equation is deterministic for wave function evolution but the wave function describes the system only probabilistically
for many experiments it is possible to think of the initial and final conditions of the system as being a particle in some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by which a particle might pass from initial to final condition it is an important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed only the initial and final conditions are definite and as stated in the foregoing paragraph they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent in every case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision an example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible
classical kinematics does not primarily demand experimental description of its phenomena it allows completely precise description of an instantaneous state by a value in phase space the cartesian product of configuration and momentum spaces this description simply assumes or imagines a state as a physically existing entity without concern about its experimental measurability such a description of an initial condition together with newton's laws of motion allows a precise deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition with a definite trajectory of passage hamiltonian dynamics can be used for this classical kinematics also allows the description of a process analogous to the initial and final condition description used by quantum mechanics lagrangian mechanics applies to this for processes that need account to be taken of actions of a small number of planck constants classical kinematics is not adequate; quantum mechanics is needed
=== relativity and quantum mechanics ===
even with the defining postulates of both einstein's theory of general relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence and while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically (at least with regard to their primary claims) they have proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent cohesive model
einstein himself is well known for rejecting some of the claims of quantum mechanics while clearly contributing to the field he did not accept many of the more "philosophical consequences and interpretations" of quantum mechanics such as the lack of deterministic causality he is famously quoted as saying in response to this aspect "my god does not play with dice" he also had difficulty with the assertion that a single subatomic particle can occupy numerous areas of space at one time however he was also the first to notice some of the apparently exotic consequences of entanglement and used them to formulate the einsteinpodolskyrosen paradox in the hope of showing that quantum mechanics had unacceptable implications if taken as a complete description of physical reality this was 1935 but in 1964 it was shown by john bell (see bell inequality) that - although einstein was correct in identifying seemingly paradoxical implications of quantum mechanical nonlocality - these implications could be experimentally tested alain aspect's initial experiments in 1982 and many subsequent experiments since have definitively verified quantum entanglement
according to the paper of j bell and the copenhagen interpretationthe common interpretation of quantum mechanics by physicists since 1927 - and contrary to einstein's ideas quantum mechanics was not at the same time a "realistic" theory and a "local" theory
the einsteinpodolskyrosen paradox shows in any case that there exist experiments by which one can measure the state of one particle and instantaneously change the state of its entangled partner - although the two particles can be an arbitrary distance apart however this effect does not violate causality since no transfer of information happens quantum entanglement forms the basis of quantum cryptography which is used in high-security commercial applications in banking and government
gravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applications however the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant "theory of everything" (toe) consequently resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th and 21st century physics many prominent physicists including stephen hawking have labored for many years in the attempt to discover a theory underlying everything this toe would combine not only the different models of subatomic physics but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature - the strong force electromagnetism the weak force and gravity - from a single force or phenomenon while stephen hawking was initially a believer in the theory of everything after considering gdel's incompleteness theorem he has concluded that one is not obtainable and has stated so publicly in his lecture "gdel and the end of physics" (2002)
=== attempts at a unified field theory ===
the quest to unify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics is still ongoing quantum electrodynamics (or "quantum electromagnetism") which is currently (in the perturbative regime at least) the most accurately tested physical theory in competition with general relativity,(blog) has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electroweak force and work is currently being done to merge the electroweak and strong force into the electrostrong force current predictions state that at around 1014 gev the three aforementioned forces are fused into a single unified field beyond this "grand unification" it is speculated that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge symmetries expected to occur at roughly 1019 gev however and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics the expanded general relativity currently the best theory describing the gravitation force has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory one of those searching for a coherent toe is edward witten a theoretical physicist who formulated the m-theory which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based string theory m-theory posits that our apparent 4-dimensional spacetime is in reality actually an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension although 7 of the spatial dimensions are - at lower energies - completely "compactified" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement or probing
another popular theory is loop quantum gravity (lqg) a theory first proposed by carlo rovelli that describes the quantum properties of gravity it is also a theory of quantum space and quantum time because in general relativity the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of gravity lqg is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativity the main output of the theory is a physical picture of space where space is granular the granularity is a direct consequence of the quantization it has the same nature of the granularity of the photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism or the discrete levels of the energy of the atoms but here it is space itself which is discrete more precisely space can be viewed as an extremely fine fabric or network "woven" of finite loops these networks of loops are called spin networks the evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam the predicted size of this structure is the planck length which is approximately 1.6161035 m according to theory there is no meaning to length shorter than this (cf planck scale energy) therefore lqg predicts that not just matter but also space itself has an atomic structure
== philosophical implications ==
since its inception the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations even fundamental issues such as max born's basic rules concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists richard feynman once said "i think i can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics." according to steven weinberg "there is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics."
the copenhagen interpretation - due largely to the danish theoretical physicist niels bohr - remains the quantum mechanical formalism that is currently most widely accepted amongst physicists some 75 years after its enunciation according to this interpretation the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory but instead must be considered a final renunciation of the classical idea of "causality." it is also believed therein that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement due to the conjugate nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations
albert einstein himself one of the founders of quantum theory rejected the quantum theoretical doctrine that the state of a system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement he held that underlying quantum mechanics there should be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against action at a distance; in other words he insisted on the principle of locality he inferred that the present theory was incomplete contrary to the copenhagen doctrine that it is complete he therefore produced a series of objections the most famous of which has become known as the einsteinpodolskyrosen paradox
john bell showed that this "epr" paradox led to experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added hidden variables experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics thereby demonstrating that quantum mechanics cannot be improved upon by addition of hidden variables the bohr-einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the copenhagen interpretation from an epistemological point of view
the everett many-worlds interpretation formulated in 1956 holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes this is not accomplished by introducing some "new axiom" to quantum mechanics but on the contrary by removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet all of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus (including the observer) are present in a real physical - not just formally mathematical as in other interpretations - quantum superposition such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an entangled state while the multiverse is deterministic we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities because we can only observe the universe (i.e. the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we as observers inhabit everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with john bell's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable however according to the theory of quantum decoherence these "parallel universes" will never be accessible to us the inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done the measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number of other particles some of which are photons flying away at the speed of light towards the other end of the universe in order to prove that the wave function did not collapse one would have to bring all these particles back and measure them again together with the system that was originally measured not only is this completely impractical but even if one could theoretically do this it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory) in light of these bell tests cramer (1986) formulated his transactional interpretation relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s as the modern derivative of the copenhagen interpretation
== applications ==
quantum mechanics has had enormous success in explaining many of the features of our universe quantum mechanics is often the only tool available that can reveal the individual behaviors of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter (electrons protons neutrons photons and others) quantum mechanics has strongly influenced string theories candidates for a theory of everything (see reductionism)
quantum mechanics is also critically important for understanding how individual atoms combine covalently to form molecules the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry relativistic quantum mechanics can in principle mathematically describe most of chemistry quantum mechanics can also provide quantitative insight into ionic and covalent bonding processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others and the magnitudes of the energies involved furthermore most of the calculations performed in modern computational chemistry rely on quantum mechanics
a great deal of modern technological inventions operate at a scale where quantum effects are significant examples include the laser the transistor (and thus the microchip) the electron microscope and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) the study of semiconductors led to the invention of the diode and the transistor which are indispensable parts of modern electronics systems and devices
researchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states efforts are being made to more fully develop quantum cryptography which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information a more distant goal is the development of quantum computers which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers instead of using classical bits quantum computers use qubits which can be in superpositions of states another active research topic is quantum teleportation which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances
quantum tunneling is vital to the operation of many devices even in the simple light switch the electrons in the electric current could not penetrate the potential barrier made up of a layer of oxide without quantum tunneling flash memory chips found in usb drives use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells
while quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale superfluidity the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero is one well-known example so is the closely related phenomenon of superconductivity the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an electric current) at sufficiently low temperatures
quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena such as black-body radiation and the stability of the orbitals of electrons in atoms it has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems including smell receptors and protein structures recent work on photosynthesis has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this fundamental process of plants and many other organisms even so classical physics can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant

for example consider a free particle in quantum mechanics there is waveparticle duality so the properties of the particle can be described as the properties of a wave therefore its quantum state can be represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function the position and momentum of the particle are observables the uncertainty principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision however one can measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle creating an eigenstate of position with a wave function that is very large (a dirac delta) at a particular position x and zero everywhere else if one performs a position measurement on such a wave function the resultant x will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e. with full certainty or complete precision) this is called an eigenstate of positionor stated in mathematical terms a generalized position eigenstate (eigendistribution) if the particle is in an eigenstate of position then its momentum is completely unknown on the other hand if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum then its position is completely unknown in an eigenstate of momentum having a plane wave form it can be shown that the wavelength is equal to h/p where h is planck's constant and p is the momentum of the eigenstate
=== step potential ===
the potential in this case is given by:
the solutions are superpositions of left- and right-moving waves:
where the wave vectors are related to the energy via
 and
with coefficients a and b determined from the boundary conditions and by imposing a continuous derivative on the solution
each term of the solution can be interpreted as an incident reflected or transmitted component of the wave allowing the calculation of transmission and reflection coefficients notably in contrast to classical mechanics incident particles with energies greater than the potential step are partially reflected
=== rectangular potential barrier ===
this is a model for the quantum tunneling effect which plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and scanning tunneling microscopy quantum tunneling is central to physical phenomena involved in superlattices
=== particle in a box ===
the particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels the box is defined as having zero potential energy everywhere inside a certain region and infinite potential energy everywhere outside that region for the one-dimensional case in the direction the time-independent schrdinger equation may be written
with the differential operator defined by
the previous equation is evocative of the classic kinetic energy analogue
with state in this case having energy coincident with the kinetic energy of the particle
the general solutions of the schrdinger equation for the particle in a box are
or from euler's formula
the infinite potential walls of the box determine the values of c d and k at x = 0 and x = l where must be zero thus at x = 0
and d = 0 at x = l
in which c cannot be zero as this would conflict with the born interpretation therefore since sin(kl) = 0 kl must be an integer multiple of 
the quantization of energy levels follows from this constraint on k since
=== finite potential well ===
a finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells having finite depth
the finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well instead the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well
=== harmonic oscillator ===
as in the classical case the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by
this problem can either be treated by directly solving the schrdinger equation which is not trivial or by using the more elegant "ladder method" first proposed by paul dirac the eigenstates are given by
where hn are the hermite polynomials
and the corresponding energy levels are
this is another example illustrating the quantization of energy for bound states
