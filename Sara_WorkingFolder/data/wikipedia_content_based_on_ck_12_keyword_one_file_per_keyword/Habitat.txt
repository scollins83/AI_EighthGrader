a habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by human a particular species of animal plant or other type of organism a place where a living thing lives is its habitat it is a place where it can find food shelter protection and mates for reproduction it is the natural environment in which an organism lives or the physical environment that surrounds a species population
a habitat is made up of physical factors such as soil moisture range of temperature and availability of light as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and the presence of predators a habitat is not necessarily a geographic areafor a parasitic organism it is the body of its host part of the host's body such as the digestive tract or a cell within the host's body
== microhabitat ==
a microhabitat is the small-scale physical requirements of a particular organism or population
== monotypic habitat ==
the monotypic habitat occurs in botanical and zoological contexts and is a component of conservation biology in restoration ecology of native plant communities or habitats some invasive species create monotypic stands that replace and/or prevent other species especially indigenous ones from growing there a dominant colonization can occur from retardant chemicals exuded nutrient monopolization or from lack of natural controls such as herbivores or climate that keep them in balance with their native habitats the yellow starthistle centaurea solstitialis is a botanical monotypic-habitat example of this currently dominating over 15,000,000 acres (61,000 km2) in california alone the non-native freshwater zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha that colonizes areas of the great lakes and the mississippi river watershed without its home-range predator control is a zoological monotypic-habitat example even though its name may seem to imply simplicity as compared with polytypic habitats the monotypic habitat can be complex
