the tymovirales are a newly established order of viruses in the 2009 classification with four families this group consists of viruses which have (+) sense single stranded rna genomes without dna intermediates their genetic material is protected by a special coat protein
== description ==
the tymovirales are mainly plant pathogens first described in 2004 they are characterised by similarities in their replication-associated polyproteins these account for the majority of their genomic coding capacity they are considered to form a group phylogenetically referred to as flexiviruses with filamentous virions
== additional species ==
a new virus - sclerotinia sclerotiorum deltaflexivirus 1 - has been described that appears to belong to a new genus in this family the name deltaflexiviridae has been proposed for this genus
