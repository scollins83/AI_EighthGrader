a freemartin or free-martin (sometimes martin heifer) is an infertile female mammal with masculinized behavior and non-functioning ovaries genetically the animal is chimeric: karyotyping of a sample of cells shows xx/xy chromosomes the animal originates as a female (xx) but acquires the male (xy) component in utero by exchange of some cellular material from a male twin via vascular connections between placentas externally the animal appears female but various aspects of female reproductive development are altered due to acquisition of anti-mllerian hormone from the male twin freemartinism is the normal outcome of mixed-sex twins in all cattle species that have been studied and it also occurs occasionally in other mammals including sheep goats and pigs
== historyedit ==
freemartins are known to have been described by the roman writer varro who called them "taura"
the 18th-century physician john hunter discovered that a freemartin always has a male twin
it was hypothesized early in the 20th century that masculinizing factors travel from the male twin to the female twin through the vascular connections of the placenta because of the vascular fusion and affect the internal anatomy of the female
several researchers made the discovery that a freemartin results when a female fetus has its chorion fuse in the uterus with that of a male twin the result was published in 1916 by tandler and keller the discovery was made independently by american biologist frank r lillie who published it in science in 1916 both teams are now credited with the discovery
in rural areas folklore often claimed this condition was not just peculiar to cattle but extended also to human twins; this belief perpetuated for generations as was mentioned in the writings of bede
=== etymologyedit ===
the etymology of the term "freemartin" is uncertain: speculations include that "free" may indicate "willing" (referring to the freemartin's willingness to work) or "exempt from reproduction" (referring to its sterility or to a farmer's decision to not bother trying to breed a freemartin or both) or that it may be derived from a flemish word for a cow which gives no milk and/or has ceased to be capable of bearing offspring; "martin" is generally held to derive from an irish or gaelic word for "cow" or "heifer" although connections to martinmas have also been posited
== mechanismedit ==
in most cattle twins the blood vessels in the chorions become interconnected creating a shared circulation for both twins if both fetuses are the same sex this is of no significance but if they are different male hormones pass from the male twin to the female twin the male hormones (testosterone and anti-mllerian hormone) then masculinize the female twin and the result is a freemartin the degree of masculinization is greater if the fusion occurs earlier in the pregnancy in about ten percent of cases no fusion takes place and the female remains fertile
the male twin is largely unaffected by the fusion although the size of the testicles may be slightly reduced testicle size is associated with fertility so there may be some reduction in bull fertility
freemartins behave and grow in a similar way to castrated male cattle (steers)
== diagnosisedit ==
if suspected a test can be done to detect the presence of the male y-chromosomes in some circulating white blood cells of the subject genetic testing for the y-chromosome can be performed within days of birth and can aid in the early identification of a sterile female bovine
physical examination of the calf may also reveal differences: many (but not all) freemartins have a short vagina compared with that of a fertile heifer
== other animalsedit ==
a freemartin is the normal outcome of mixed twins in all cattle species which have been studied it does not normally occur in most other mammals though it has been recorded in sheep goats and pigs
== usesedit ==
freemartins are occasionally used in stem cell and immunology research during fetal development cells are exchanged between the fused circulations of the bovine twins up to 95% of the freemartin's blood cells can be derived from those of her twin brother male-derived cells and their progeny can be easily visualized in the freemartin tissues as only they contain the male y chromosome thus by analyzing these tissues one can investigate the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells or other circulating cells to produce other tissues in addition to blood the freemartin model allows one to analyze perfectly healthy and unmanipulated animals without resorting to transplantation often used in stem cell research
== fictional useedit ==
in the aldous huxley novel brave new world a "freemartin" (mentioned in chapters 1 3 11 and 17) is a woman who has been deliberately made sterile by exposure to hormones during fetal development; in the book government policy requires freemartins to comprise 70% of the female population
the robert a heinlein novel beyond this horizon lists "the clever and repulsively beautiful pseudo-feminine freemartins" as one of the genetically-engineered specialist types of humans that were created in the "empire of the great khans" (chapter 2)
in the robert heinlein novel farnham's freehold the protagonist hugh farnham is given a companion (bedwarmer) that is described as a natural freemartin
in the avram davidson story "the house the blakeneys built" the cattle are freemartins
in the fantasy book series bazil broketail by christopher rowley "freemartin" is the name for a breed of sterile female dragons
in footfall by larry niven and jerry pournelle a lithely built human woman uses the term "freemartin" to describe herself while doubting her sexuality
in nicola griffith's novel hild the title character is sometimes referred to by others as a freemartin in reference to her non-feminine character and social role
