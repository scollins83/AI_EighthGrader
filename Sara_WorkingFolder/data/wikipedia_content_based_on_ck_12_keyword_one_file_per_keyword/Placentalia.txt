placentalia ("placentals") is one of the three subdivisions of the class of animals mammalia; the other two are monotremata and marsupialia the placentals are primarily distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother where it is nourished via a placenta until the live birth of a fully developed offspring occurs
== anatomical features ==
placental mammals are anatomically distinguished from other mammals by:
a sufficiently wide opening at the bottom of the pelvis to allow the birth of a large offspring relative to the size of the mother
the absence of epipubic bones extending forward from the pelvis which are found in all other mammals (their function in non-placental mammals is to stiffen the body during locomotion but in placentals they would inhibit the expansion of the abdomen during pregnancy.)
the rearmost bones of the foot fit into a socket formed by the ends of the tibia and fibula forming a complete mortise and tenon upper ankle joint
the presence of a malleolus at the bottom of the fibula
== subdivisions ==
analysis of retroposon presence/absence patterns has provided a rapid unequivocal means for revealing the evolutionary history of organisms: this has resulted in a revision in the classification of placentals there are now thought to be three major subdivisions or lineages of placental mammals: boreoeutheria xenarthra and afrotheria all of which diverged from common ancestors
the orders of placental mammals in the three groups are:
magnorder afrotheria (elephant shrews tenrecs golden moles hyraxes elephants and manatees)
superorder afroinsectiphilia
order afrosoricida (tenrecs and golden moles)
order macroscelidea (elephant shrews)
order tubulidentata (aardvark)
superorder paenungulata
order hyracoidea (hyraxes)
order proboscidea (elephants)
order sirenia (dugongs and manatees)
magnorder boreoeutheria
superorder euarchontoglires (treeshrews colugos primates rabbits hares and rodents)
grandorder gliriformes
mirorder glires
order lagomorpha (rabbits hares and pikas)
order rodentia (rodents: mice rats voles squirrels beavers etc.)
grandorder euarchonta
order scandentia (treeshrews)
mirorder primatomorpha
order dermoptera (colugos)
order primates (primates: monkeys apes lemurs lorises etc.)
superorder laurasiatheria (hedgehogs shrews moles whales bats dogs cats seals and hoofed mammals)
grandorder eulipotyphla
order erinaceomorpha (hedgehogs and gymnures)
order soricomorpha (shrews moles and solenodons)
grandorder scrotifera
order pholidota (pangolins)
order chiroptera (bats)
order cetacea (whales)
order artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates: cattle antelope deer camels pigs etc.)
order perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates: horses donkeys zebras rhinoceroses and tapirs)
order carnivora (carnivorans: dogs cats bears seals mongooses etc.)
magnorder xenarthra (armadillos anteaters and sloths)
order cingulata (armadillos)
order pilosa (anteaters and sloths)
the exact relationships among these three lineages is currently a subject of debate and three different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal or diverged first from other placentals these hypotheses are atlantogenata (basal boreoeutheria) epitheria (basal xenarthra) and exafroplacentalia (basal afrotheria) estimates for the divergence times among these three placental groups range from 105 to 120 million years ago (mya) depending on the type of dna (e.g nuclear or mitochondrial) and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data
== evolution ==
true placental mammals (the crown group including all modern placentals) arose from stem-group members of the clade eutheria which had existed since at least the middle jurassic period about 170 mya) these early eutherians were small nocturnal insect eaters with adaptations for life in trees
true placentals probably originated in the late cretaceous around 90 mya but the earliest undisputed fossils are from the early paleocene 66 mya following the disappearance of the dinosaurs the stem ungulate protungulatum donnae is known 1 meter above the cretaceous-paleogene boundary that marks the disappearance of the dinosaurs and the stem primate purgatorius appears no more than 300,000 years after the k-pg boundary the rapid appearance of placentals after the mass extinction at the end of the cretaceous suggests that the group had already originated and undergone an initial diversification in the late cretaceous as suggested by molecular clocks the lineages leading to xenarthra and afrotheria probably originated around 90 mya and boreoeutheria underwent an initial diversification around 70-80 mya producing the lineages that eventually would lead to modern primates rodents insectivores artiodactyls and carnivorans consistent with this a single tooth of protungulatum was recently discovered below the k-pg boundary which formed around 66 mya
however modern members of the placental orders originated in the paleogene around 66 to 23 mya following the extinction of the dinosaurs the evolution of crown orders such modern primates rodents and carnivores appears to be part of an adaptive radiation that took place as mammals quickly evolved to take advantage of ecological niches that were left open when the dinosaurs and other animals disappeared following the chicxulub asteroid impact as they occupied new niches mammals rapidly increased in body size and began to take over the large herbivore and large carnivore niches that had been left open by the disappearance of the dinosaurs mammals also exploited niches that the dinosaurs had never touched: for example bats evolved flight and echolocation allowing them to be highly effective nocturnal aerial insectivores; and whales first occupied freshwater lakes and rivers and then moved into the oceans primates meanwhile acquired specialized grasping hands and feet which allowed them to grasp branches and large eyes with keener vision which allowed them to forage in the dark
the evolution of land placentals followed different pathways on different continents since they cannot easily cross large bodies of water an exception is smaller placentals such as rodents and primates who left laurasia and colonized africa and then south america via rafting
in africa the afrotheria underwent a major adaptive radiation which led to elephants elephant shrews tenrecs golden moles aardvarks and manatees in south america a similar event occurred with radiation of the xenarthra which led to modern sloths anteaters and armadillos as well as the extinct ground sloths and glyptodonts expansion in laurasia was dominated by boreoeutheria which includes primates and rodents insectivores carnivores perissodactyls and artiodactyls these groups expanded beyond a single continent when land bridges formed linking africa to eurasia and south america to north america
