multicellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell in contrast to unicellular organisms
all species of animals land plants and filamentous fungi are multicellular as are many algae while a few organisms are partially uni- and partially multicellular like slime moulds and social amoebae such as the genus dictyostelium
multicellular organisms arise in various different ways for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells colonial or organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony but pluricellular colonies have evolved independently in volvox and some flagellated green algae that form coenobia
in volvox the cells comprising the colony arise by cell division and are of two different types specialized for different functions the approximately 2000 flagellate somatic cells forming the outer spherical shell of the colony are identical and are similar in structure to their free-living unicellular relative chlamydomonas but are incapable of cell division reproduction in volvox is carried out specialized cells called "gonidia" that are larger than the somatic cells lack flagella and cannot swim but can divide to form new colonies
the evolution of multicellularity from unicellular ancestors has been replicated in the laboratory in evolution experiments using predation as the selective pressure
== evolutionary history ==
=== occurrence ===
multicellularity has evolved independently at least 46 times including in some prokaryotes like cyanobacteria myxobacteria actinomycetes magnetoglobus multicellularis or methanosarcina however complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals fungi brown algae red algae green algae and land plants it evolved repeatedly for chloroplastida (green algae and land plants) once or twice for animals once for brown algae three times in the fungi (chytrids ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) and perhaps several times for slime molds and red algae
the first evidence of multicellularity is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived 3-3.5 billion years ago in order to reproduce true multicellular organisms must solve the problem of regenerating a whole organism from germ cells (i.e sperm and egg cells) an issue that is studied in developmental biology
animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100150 different cell types) compared with 1020 in plants fungi and protoctists
=== loss of multicellularity ===
loss of multicellularity occurred in some groups fungi are predominantly multicellular though early diverging lineages are largely unicellular (e.g. microsporidia) and there have been numerous reversions to unicellularity across fungi (e.g. saccharomycotina cryptococcus and other yeasts) it may also have occurred in some red algae (e.g. porphyridium) but it is possible that they are primitivelly unicellular) loss of multicellularity is also considered probable in some green algae (e.g. chlorella vulgaris and some ulvophyceae) in other groups generally parasites a reduction of multicellularity occurred in number or types of cells (e.g. the myxozoans multicellular organisms early thought to be unicellular are probably extremely reduced cnidarians)
=== cancer ===
multicellular organisms especially long-living animals face the challenge of cancer which occurs when cells fail to regulate their growth within the normal program of development changes in tissue morphology can be observed during this process cancer in animals (metazoans) has often been described as a loss of multicellularity there is a discussion about the possibility of existence of cancer in other multicellular organisms or even in protozoa for example plant galls have been characterized as tumors however other authors argue that plants do not get cancer
=== separation of somatic and germ cells ===
in some multicellular groups which are called weismannists a separation between a sterile somatic cell line and a germ cell line evolved however weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g. vertebrates arthropods volvox) as great part of species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis (e.g. land plants most algae many invertebrates)
== hypotheses for origin ==
there are various mechanisms by which multicellularity could have evolved
one hypothesis is that a group of function-specific cells aggregated into a slug-like mass called a grex which moved as a multicellular unit this is essentially what slime molds do another hypothesis is that a primitive cell underwent nucleus division thereby becoming a syncytium a membrane would then form around each nucleus (and the cellular space and organelles occupied in the space) thereby resulting in a group of connected cells in one organism (this mechanism is observable in drosophila) a third hypothesis is that as a unicellular organism divided the daughter cells failed to separate resulting in a conglomeration of identical cells in one organism which could later develop specialized tissues this is what plant and animal embryos do as well as colonial choanoflagellates
because the first multicellular organisms were simple soft organisms lacking bone shell or other hard body parts they are not well preserved in the fossil record one exception may be the demosponge which may have left a chemical signature in ancient rocks the earliest fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested grypania spiralis and the fossils of the black shales of the palaeoproterozoic francevillian group fossil b formation in gabon (gabonionta) the doushantuo formation has yielded 600 million year old microfossils with evidence of multicellular traits
until recently phylogenetic reconstruction has been through anatomical (particularly embryological) similarities this is inexact as living multicellular organisms such as animals and plants are more than 500 million years removed from their single-cell ancestors such a passage of time allows both divergent and convergent evolution time to mimic similarities and accumulate differences between groups of modern and extinct ancestral species modern phylogenetics uses sophisticated techniques such as alloenzymes satellite dna and other molecular markers to describe traits that are shared between distantly related lineages
the evolution of multicellularity could have occurred in three ways of which the latter the colonial theory is most credited by the scientific community:
=== the symbiotic theory ===
this theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from symbiosis (cooperation) of different species of single-cell organisms each with different roles over time these organisms would become so dependent on each other they would not be able to survive independently eventually leading to the incorporation of their genomes into one multicellular organism each respective organism would become a separate lineage of differentiated cells within the newly created species
this kind of severely co-dependent symbiosis can be seen frequently such as in the relationship between clown fish and riterri sea anemones in these cases it is extremely doubtful whether either species would survive very long if the other became extinct however the problem with this theory is that it is still not known how each organism's dna could be incorporated into one single genome to constitute them as a single species although such symbiosis is theorized to have occurred (e.g. mitochondria and chloroplasts in animal and plant cells endosymbiosis) it has happened only extremely rarely and even then the genomes of the endosymbionts have retained an element of distinction separately replicating their dna during mitosis of the host species for instance the two or three symbiotic organisms forming the composite lichen while dependent on each other for survival have to separately reproduce and then re-form to create one individual organism once more
=== the cellularization (syncytial) theory ===
this theory states that a single unicellular organism with multiple nuclei could have developed internal membrane partitions around each of its nuclei many protists such as the ciliates or slime molds can have several nuclei lending support to this hypothesis however the simple presence of multiple nuclei is not enough to support the theory multiple nuclei of ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated functions the macronucleus serves the organism's needs while the micronucleus is used for sexual reproduction with exchange of genetic material slime molds syncitia form from individual amoeboid cells like syncitial tissues of some multicellular organisms not the other way round to be deemed valid this theory needs a demonstrable example and mechanism of generation of a multicellular organism from a pre-existing syncytium
=== the colonial theory ===
the third explanation of multicellularisation is the colonial theory proposed by haeckel in 1874 this theory claims that the symbiosis of many organisms of the same species (unlike the symbiotic theory which suggests the symbiosis of different species) led to a multicellular organism at least some it is presumed land-evolved multicellularity occurs by cells separating and then rejoining (e.g. cellular slime molds) whereas for the majority of multicellular types (those that evolved within aquatic environments) multicellularity occurs as a consequence of cells failing to separate following division the mechanism of this latter colony formation can be as simple as incomplete cytokinesis though multicellularity is also typically considered to involve cellular differentiation
the advantage of the colonial theory hypothesis is that it has been seen to occur independently in 16 different protoctistan phyla for instance during food shortages the amoeba dictyostelium groups together in a colony that moves as one to a new location some of these amoeba then slightly differentiate from each other other examples of colonial organisation in protista are volvocaceae such as eudorina and volvox the latter of which consists of up to 50050,000 cells (depending on the species) only a fraction of which reproduce for example in one species 2535 cells reproduce 8 asexually and around 1525 sexually however it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms as the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed "pluricellular" rather than "multicellular" this problem plagues most hypotheses of how multicellularisation could have occurred
=== the synzoospore theory ===
some authors suggest that the origin of multicellularity at least in metazoa occurred due to a transition from temporal to spatial cell differentiation rather than through a gradual evolution of cell differentiation as affirmed in haeckels gastraea theory
== experimental evidence ==
the evolution of multicellularity from unicellular ancestors has been modeled in the laboratory in evolution experiments using predation as the selective pressure similar experiments can demonstrate the facultative induction of multicellularity
== advantages ==
multicellularity allows an organism to exceed the size limits normally imposed by diffusion: single cells with increased size have a decreased surface-to-volume ratio and have difficulty in absorbing sufficient nutrients and transporting them throughout the cell this confers multicellular organisms with the competitive advantages of an increase in size it also permits increasing complexity by allowing the differentiation of numerous cellular lineages within an organism being multicellular also benefits with having a longer life span thus still living even when a single-cell dies
