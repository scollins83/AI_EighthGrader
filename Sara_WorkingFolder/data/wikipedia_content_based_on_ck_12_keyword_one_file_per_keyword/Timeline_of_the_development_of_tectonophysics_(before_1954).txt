the evolution of tectonophysics is closely linked to the history of the continental drift and plate tectonics hypotheses the continental drift/ airy-heiskanen isostasy hypothesis had many flaws and scarce data the fixist/ pratt-hayford isostasy the contracting earth and the expanding earth concepts had many flaws as well
the idea of continents with a permanent location the geosyncline theory the pratt-hayford isostasy the extrapolation of the age of the earth by lord kelvin as a black body cooling down the contracting earth the earth as a solid and crystalline body is one school of thought a lithosphere creeping over the asthenosphere is a logical consequence of an earth with internal heat by radioactivity decay the airy-heiskanen isostasy thrust faults and niskanen's mantle viscosity determinations
== introduction ==
first there was the creationism (martin luther) and the age of the earth was 6000 years there were stacks of calcareous rocks of maritime origin above sea level and up and down motions were allowed (geosyncline hypothesis james hall and james d dana) later on the thrust fault concept appeared and a contracting earth (eduard suess james d dana albert heim) was its driving force in 1862 the physicist william thomson (who later became lord kelvin) calculated the age of earth (as a cooling black body) at between 20 million and 400 million years in 1895 john perry produced an age of earth estimate of 2 to 3 billion years old using a model of a convective mantle and thin crust finally arthur holmes published the age of the earth an introduction to geological ideas in 1927 in which he presented a range of 1.6 to 3.0 billion years
wegener had data for assuming that the relative positions of the continents change over time it was a mistake to state the continents "plowed" through the sea although it isn't sure that this fixist quote is true in the original in german he was an outsider with a doctorate in astronomy attacking an established theory between 'geophysicists' the geophysicists were right to state that the earth is solid and the mantle is elastic (for seismic waves) and inhomogeneous and the ocean floor would not allow the movement of the continents but excluding one alternative substantiates the opposite alternative: passive continents and an active seafloor spreading and subduction with accretion belts on the edges of the continents the velocity of the sliding continents was allowed in the uncertainty of the fixed continent model and seafloor subduction and upwelling with phase change allows for inhomogeneity
the problem too was the specialisation arthur holmes and alfred rittmann saw it right (rittmann 1939) only an outsider can have the overview only an outsider sees the forest not only the trees (hellman 1998b p 145) but a wegener did not have the specialisation to correctly weight the quality of the geophysical data and the paleontologic data and its conclusions wegener's main interest was meteorology and he wanted to join the denmark-greenland expedition scheduled for mid 1912 so he hurried up to present his continental drift hypothesis
mainly charles lyell harold jeffreys james d dana charles schuchert chester longwell and the conflict with the axis powers slowed down the acceptance of continental drifting (rodney 2012)

note: francis bacon was thinking of western africa and western south america and theodor lilienthal was thinking about the sunken island of atlantis and changing sea levels

catastrophism (e.g christian fundamentalism william thomson) vs uniformitarianism (e.g charles lyell thomas henry huxley) (hellman 1998a)
term coined by william whewell
uniformitarism is the prevailing view in the u.s (oreskes 2002)
charles lyell assumed that land masses changed their location but he assumed a mechanism of vertical movement (krill 2011) james dwight dana assumed a permanent location as well influencing the american fixist school of thought (irving 2005) it wasn't known that the seafloor isn't mainly granite rock (sial) (as the continental cratons) but mainly basalt rock (sima)
quote lyell: "continents therefore although permanent for whole geological epochs shift their positions entirely in the course of ages." ((lyell 1875 p 258) cited in (summerhayes 1990))
quote wallace about dana: "in 1856 in articles in the american journal he discussed the development of the american continent and argued for its general permanence; and in his manual of geology in 1863 and later editions the same views were more fully enforced and were latterly applied to all continents." ((dana 1863) cited in (wallace 2007 p 342))
pratt's isostasy is the prevailing view (oreskes 2002):
airy-heiskanen model; where different topographic heights are accommodated by changes in crustal thickness
pratt-hayford model; where different topographic heights are accommodated by lateral changes in rock density
vening meinesz or flexural model; where the lithosphere acts as an elastic plate and its inherent rigidity distributes local topographic loads over a broad region by bending
a cooling and contracting earth is the prevailing view

the vertical movement of scandinavia after the ice age is accepted (recent average uplift c 1 cm/year) this implies a certain plasticity under the crust (flint 1947).the alpine geology with its theory of thrusting (as geosyncline hypothesis; today's thrust tectonics) accepted horizontal movements (suess 1875) cited in (holmes 1929a)

eduard suess proposed gondwanaland in 1861 as a result of the glossopteris findings but he believed that the oceans flooded the spaces currently between those lands and he proposed the tethys sea in 1893 he came to the conclusion that the alps to the north were once at the bottom of an ocean (suess 1901)

although wegener's theory was formed independently and was more complete than those of his predecessors wegener later credited a number of past authors with similar ideas: franklin coxworthy (between 1848 and 1890) roberto mantovani (between 1889 and 1909) william henry pickering (1907) and frank bursley taylor (1908) (wegener 1929)
1912-1929: alfred wegener develops his continental drift hypothesis (wegener 1912a wegener 1929)
in the 1920s earth scientists refer to themselves as drifters (or mobilists) or fixists (frankel 1987 p 206) terms introduced by the swiss geologist mile argand in 1924 (krill 2011)
moreover most of the blistering attacks were aimed at wegener himself an outsider (phd in astronomy) who seemed to be attacking the very foundations of geology
== controversy ==
1912 wegener presents his ideas at the german geological society frankfurt (wegener 1912a) karl erich andre (university of marburg) must have delivered him some references strong points:
matching of the coastlines of eastern south america and western africa and many similarities between the respective coastlines of north america and europe
numerous geological similarities between africa and south america and others between north america and europe
many examples of past and present-day life forms having a geographically disjunctive distribution
mountain ranges are usually located along the coastlines of the continents and orogenic regions are long and narrow in shape
the earth's crust exhibits two basic elevations one corresponding to the elevation of the continental tables the other to the ocean floors
the permo-carboniferous moraine deposits found in south africa argentina southern brazil india and in western central and eastern australia (frankel 1987 pp 205206)
flooded land-bridges contradict isostasy
note i: wegener described in a sentence the seafloor spreading in the first publication only but he believed it is a consequence of the continental drift (wegener 1912a in jacoby 1981) he abandoned this sentence probably under the advice of emanuel kayser university of marburg
note ii: petermanns geographische mitteilungen is one of the leading geographical monthlies of international reputation (ruud 1930); wladimir kppen (father-in-law) (kppen 1921a) (kppen 1921b) (kppen 1925) and kurt wegener (brother) (wegener 1925) (wegener 1941) (wegener 1942) defended there the continental drift hypothesis in a somewhat mirror controversy (in demhardt 2005)
note iii: although the climate distribution was not always similar to nowadays in the carboniferous coal mines are remains of the equatorial realm glaciation remains are near the south pole and between glaciation and equatorial realm (centered between latitude 30 and the tropic of cancer and the capricorn) there are remains of deserts (evaporites salt lakes and sand dunes) (brusatte 2004 p 4) these are consequences of the evaporation rate and the atmospheric circulation
1912 patrick marshall uses the term "andesite line"
1914 the idea of a strong outer layer (lithosphere) overlying a weak asthenosphere is introduced (barrel 1914)
h jeffreys and others most important criticisms (frankel 1987 p 211) (hellman 1998 p 146):
continents can not "plow" through the sea because the seafloor is denser than the continental crust
pole-fleeing force is too weak to move continents and produce mountains
paul sophus epstein calculated it to be one millionth of the gravity
if the tidal force moves continents than the earth's rotation would stop after only one year
daly reginald a (1926) our mobile earth new york: charles scribner's sons
its opening sentence is galileo's allegedly muttered rebellious phrase and yet it moves
quote: "daly,... seeks to substitute sliding for drifting assuming that broad domes or bulges form at the earth's surface and on the flanks of these domes the continental masses slide downward moving over hot basaltic glass as over a lubricated floor" (pp 170291)
by the mid-1920s a holmes had rejected contractionism and he had introduced a model with convection (frankel 1987 p 212) (holmes 1929a) (holmes 1929b) (holmes 1944)
note: in a way not only a wegener (wegener 1912a in jacobi 1981) but a holmes and k wegener suggested seafloor spreading as well (holmes 1929c in vine 1966) (wegener 1942 in demhardt 2005)
the alps were and still are the best investigated orogen worldwide otto ampferer (austrian geological survey) rejected contractionism 1906 and he defended convection locally only at first otto ampferer even used the word swallowed in a geological sense the geological society meeting in innsbruck held on 29 august 1912 changed a paradigm (t termier words the acceptance of nappes and thrust faults) so that mile argand (1916) speculated that the alps were caused by the north motion of the african shield and finally accepted this reason 1922 following wegener's continental drift theory (argand 1922 as staub 1924) otto ampferer in the mean time at the geological society meeting in vienna held on 4 april 1919 defended the link between the alpine faulting and wegener's continental drift.quote translation: "the alpine orogeny is the effect of the migration of the north african shield smoothing only alpine folds and nappes on the cross section between the black forest and africa once again then from the present distance of about 1,800 km we have an initial gap of around 3,000 to 3,500 km ie a pressing of the alpine region alpine region in a broader sense of 1,500 km to this amount must be africa have moved to europe this brings us then to a true large scale continental drift of the african shield" (staub 1924 p 257) cited in (wegener 1929 p 10)
w.a.j.m van waterschoot van der gracht bailey willis rollin t chamberlin john joly g.a.f molengraaff j.w gregory alfred wegener charles schuchert chester r longwell frank bursley taylor william bowie david white joseph t singewald jr. and edward w berry participated on a symposium of the american association of petroleum geologists (aapg 1926) (van der gracht 1926) although the chairman favored the drift hypothesis it ceased to be an acceptable geological investigation subject in many universities under the influence of jeffreys (1924) book (machamer pera & baltas 2000 pp 7275)
quote university of chicago geologist rollin t chamberlin: "if we are to believe in wegener's hypothesis we must forget everything which has been learned in the past 70 years and start all over again." (hellman 1998b) (sullivan 1991 p 15)
quote bailey willis: "further discussion of it merely incumbers the literature and befogs the mind of fellow students (it is) as antiquated as pre-curie physics" (hellman 1998b p 150) (hallam 1983 p 136)
bailey willis and william bowie saw the sima with great strength and rigidity through the seismological studies and tidal forces would act more on the sima (2800 to 3300 kg/m3) as it is denser than the sial (2700 to 2800 kg/m3) (frankel 1987 p 211)
