== plot ==
a man with neanderthal features and wearing pajamas stumbles through the arizona desert falls and dies dr matt hastings (john agar) a bright handsome and sympathetic doctor from the small town of desert rock is called to view the body asked to give an opinion as to cause of death he finds himself perplexed surprised to learn the deceased was someone he knew biological research scientist eric jacobs dr hastings suggests he be given permission to perform an autopsy to learn why the man's face is distorted beyond recognition the sheriff refuses judging an autopsy unnecessary as jacobs' associate dr gerald deemer (leo g carroll) signed the death certificate and there is no indication of foul play
curious to learn more dr hastings drives twenty miles out of town to visit dr deemer in his lab hastings learns that deemer and jacobs have been conducting experiments on animals in an effort to use an atomic isotope to create a super food nutrient foreseeing a future when human population growth would outstrip food production and result in food shortages their hope was to create a viable replacement for food and prevent widespread starvation
he learns that the scientists' experiments proved successful in one respect in that some animals were able to thrive and grow exclusively on the nutrient without any food yet the nutrient has not been perfected other animals have died after receiving injections and still others have kept growing to gargantuan proportions the latter include a white mouse a guinea pig and a mexican red rumped tarantula
deemer tells hastings that the cause of jacobs' death was his impatience to see if the latest batch of the nutrient would sustain humans as a result jacob injected himself with the nutrient which resulted in runaway acromegaly which killed him in four days what deemer does not reveal is that jacobs also injected his research assistant paul lund with the same nutrient
after hasting leaves the deformed lund appears attacks deemer and partially destroys the lab during this rampage the lab catches fire and the glass front of the tarantula's cage is shattered lund grabs the hypodermic that deemer was going to use to inject an animal and injects deemer instead
during the melee the arachnid escapes outdoors unnoticed lund collapses and dies deemer - who had been unconscious - regains consciousness grabs a fire extinguisher and puts out the fire intending to continue his work without questions or objections he buries lund's body and conceals all traces of the grave
the following day a new lab assistant arrives in town by bus the young and beautiful stephanie clayton (mara corday) who goes by the nickname "steve," has signed on to assist in the lab as part of her master's degree program told she will have to wait a couple of hours for the only taxi driver in town to return and drive her out to the lab she accepts a ride from dr hastings who is also headed there
when they arrive and see the damage dr deemer tells them that the fire was caused by an equipment malfunction he indicates that all the animals were killed in the fire and avoids answering questions about what happened to his previous research assistant as steve's contract stipulates that she live in dr deemer's residence dr hastings leaves her there with her suitcases
steve begins working in the lab and proves to be a capable lab assistant even as she begins to notice disturbing changes in dr deemer's appearance and demeanor meanwhile the now house-sized tarantula ravages the countryside as dr hastings tries to unravel a mystery that includes clean-picked cattle carcasses and pools of arachnid venom up to eight feet in diameter once he puts two and two together hastings begs the sheriff to gather law enforcement personal and explosives so they can try to destroy the creature that is killing livestock and humans
the tarantula eventually returns to the lab during the night and kills dr deemer but steve escapes with dr hastings then the tarantula pursues its human quarry down the road toward the town after several failed attempts the spider is eventually destroyed by a napalm attack launched from a jet fighter squadron

the special effects showing the giant animals and the unfortunate scientist's deformity are fairly advanced for the time with real animals (including a rabbit and a guinea pig in professor deemer's lab) being used to represent the giant creatures a real spider was also used for shots where the entire monster was shown shooting miniatures were reserved for close-ups and the final shots of the creature on fire resulting in a rather more convincing monster than the giant ants seen in the earlier big-bug film them (1954) of this and the entire film jack arnold said "we decided to do this film because generally people are very afraid of spiders"
although set in arizona the film was shot in california with locations for the desert scenes in apple valley the movie was also filmed in and around the rock formations of "dead man's point" in lucerne valley california a frequently used movie location for many early western films it takes place in the fictional town of desert rock arizona
like them tarantula makes atmospheric use of its desert locations; and although a radioactive isotope does make an appearance it differs from most big-bug films in having the mutation caused by the peaceful research of a well-intentioned scientist rather than nuclear weapons and/or a mad genius director jack arnold was to use matte effects again two years later to show miniaturization rather than gigantism in the incredible shrinking man which also featured an encounter with a spider that real spider was the same one that appeared in tarantula
the film's theatrical release poster featuring a spider with two eyes instead of the normal eight and carrying a woman in its fangs does not represent any scene in the final film this gaudy depiction of a woman-in-peril had become by this time a standard b-movie poster cliche that would continue being used for years
== reception ==
film critic leonard maltin awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars praising the film's fast pacing special effects and intriguing subplot calling it "one of the best giant-insect films" the contemporary review in variety indicated "a tarantula as big as a barn puts the horror into this well-made program science-fictioner and it is quite credibly staged and played bringing off the far-fetched premise with a maximum of believability." in video movie guide 2002 authors mick martin and marsh potter characterized tarantula as " (a) pretty good entry in the giant bug subgenre of 1950s horror and science fiction movies." it currently has a very positive 92% "fresh" on rotten tomatoes with an average of 6.3/10 based on 13 reviews
