gene elden likens (born january 6 1935) is an american limnologist and ecologist he co-founded the hubbard brook ecosystem study at the hubbard brook experimental forest in 1963 and founded the cary institute of ecosystem studies in millbrook new york in 1983
a leading pioneer in long-term multidisciplinary ecological studies likens examines energy flow and biogeochemical flux models in the ecosystems of forests streams and lakes likens is best known for leading the team of scientists that discovered acid rain in north america and connected fossil fuels with increasing acidity of precipitation in addition to its scientific impact this work has influenced public debate and governmental policy particularly the united states congress's clean air act amendments of 1990
== education ==
gene likens was born in pierceton indiana likens received his b.s in zoology at manchester university (north manchester indiana) in 1957 followed by his m.s in zoology in 1959 from the university of wisconsinmadison he received his ph.d in zoology in 1962 also from the university of wisconsinmadison for his thesis on transport of radioisotopes in lakes
== career ==
=== dartmouth college ===
likens was an instructor and associate professor at dartmouth college from 1963 to 1969 in the 1960s likens did early work in the dry valleys of antarctica examining the thermal structures of lake vanda and lake bonney
=== hubbard brook experimental forest ===
likens was co-founder in 1963 of a group with f herbert bormann robert s pierce and noye m johnson working on the hubbard brook ecosystem study at the hubbard brook experimental forest in the white mountains of new hampshire the study immediately found that the rain was abnormally acidic and the group carried out one of the first scientific studies linking acid rain to air pollution such as sulphur dioxide from the use of fossil fuels
in 1988 hubbard brook was designated by the national science foundation as an lter a site for collaborative long term ecological research as of 1 june 2013 hubbard brook had been continuously studied for 50 years likens' work in the area is considered "one of the worlds most comprehensive studies on how air pollution and land use shape forested watersheds" work at mirror lake at the lower end of the hubbard brook valley has been particularly important in understanding the importance of physical chemical and biological linkages involving the lake and its watershed and airshed likens has extensively studied biogeochemical cycles describing the flow of matter within ecosystems riparian zones linking water and land are particularly important in maintaining the health of wild lands likens has also done important work on deforestation and its potential impact on the chemistry of watersheds this research has had significant impacts on programs for forest management in particular the united states forest service's adoption of a 100year rotation policy
likens and others devised a range of highly influential long-term experiments on an ecosystemic scale these include the small-watershed model of nutrient cycling in which all water entering and leaving a naturally-bounded watershed is measured enabling scientists to calculate the hydrologic budget of the watershed this model has been "extremely influential" in the examination of ecosystems and is central to the examination of urban ecosystems such as baltimore likens' work is considered "classic" and he is credited with establishing a "guiding paradigm" for other ecologists
=== cornell university ===
in 1969 likens joined the faculty of cornell university he served as an associate professor from 1969 to 1972 and as a full professor from 1972 to 1983 in addition to being a professor of ecology in the section of ecology and systematics (later named the department of ecology & evolutionary biology) he served as its acting chairman (1973-1974) and chairman (1982-1983) in january 1983 he was named cornell universitys charles a alexander professor of biological sciences while at cornell university he served as chairman of the section of ecology and systematics
=== institute of ecosystem studies ===
in 1983 likens founded the (now cary) institute of ecosystem studies in millbrook new york as part of the new york botanical garden in 1993 the ies became an independent non-profit with likens as director and president situated at the mary flagler cary arboretum it is an independent center for ecological research "whose work is highly relevant to policy concerns." in addition to managing teams of scientists and educators likens continued his research at hubbard brook each summer as of 2001 he was appointed to the first endowed chair at the institute of ecosystem studies the g evelyn hutchinson chair in ecology
in 2007 likens stepped down as director of the ies and returned to full-time research currently at the university of connecticut and as visiting professor at the university of uppsala sweden in july 2012 he began a three-year term as special adviser to the president of the university of connecticut on environmental affairs and distinguished research professor
likens has published 25 books and more than 580 papers and book chapters much of his early work is summarized in u.s geological survey publications his work has influenced the united states congress on issues such as the clean air act amendments of 1990
he has been active in a variety of organizations and has been the vice-president (1975-1976) and president (1976-1977) of the american society of limnology and oceanography; vice-president (1978-1979) president (1981-1982) and honorary fellow (2012) of the ecological society of america; president (2002) of the american institute of biological sciences; and president (2001-2007) of the international society of limnology
== awards and honors ==
likens has received a substantial number of awards and honors of various kinds he was elected to the american academy of arts and sciences in 1979 and the united states national academy of sciences in 1981 he was also elected as a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1988 the royal danish academy of sciences and letters in 1994 and the austrian academy of sciences in 2000 he became an elected member in biological sciences of the american philosophical society in 2006 he's also a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science
his awards include the 1988 eci prize in limnetic ecology the 1993 tyler prize for environmental achievement and the 2001 huxley medal of the institute of biology london uk he received a 2001 national medal of science from president george w bush on june 13 2002 in 2003 likens and dr f herbert bormann received the blue planet prize from asahi glass foundation for "for outstanding scientific research that helps to solve global environmental problems" in 2014 he received the alfred c redfield lifetime achievement award from the association for the sciences of limnology and oceanography (aslo)
he has been awarded honorary doctoral degrees internationally (universitt fr bodenkultur vienna 1992; wageningen agricultural university the netherlands 1998) as well as nationally (manchester college 1979; rutgers university 1985; plymouth state college university system of new hampshire 1989; miami university 1990; union college 1991; marist college 1993; university of connecticut 2004; montclair state university 2012)
