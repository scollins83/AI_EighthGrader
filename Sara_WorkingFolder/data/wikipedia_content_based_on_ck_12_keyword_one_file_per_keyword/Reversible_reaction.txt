a reversible reaction is a chemical reaction that results in an equilibrium mixture of reactants and products for a reaction involving two reactants and two products this can be expressed symbolically as
a and b can react to form c and d or in the reverse reaction c and d can react to form a and b this is distinct from reversible process in thermodynamics
weak acids and bases undertake reversible reactions for example carbonic acid: h2co3 (l) + h2o(l) hco3 (aq) + h3o+(aq)
the concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (a and b or c and d) and the equilibrium constant k the magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the gibbs free energy change for the reaction so when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kj mol1) then the equilibrium constant is large (log k > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction although in reality small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system a truly irreversible chemical reaction is usually achieved when one of the products exits the reacting system for example as does carbon dioxide (volatile) in the reaction
ca co3 + 2hcl cacl2 + h2o + co2
== history ==
the concept of a reversible reaction was introduced by berthollet in 1803 after he had observed the formation of sodium carbonate crystals at the edge of a salt lake (one of the natron lakes in egypt in limestone):
2nacl + caco3 na2co3 + cacl2
he recognized this as the reverse of the familiar reaction
na2co3 + cacl2 2nacl + caco3
until then chemical reactions were thought to always proceed in one direction berthollet reasoned that the excess of salt in the lake helped push the "reverse" reaction towards the formation of sodium carbonate
in 1864 waage and guldberg formulated their law of mass action which quantified berthollet's observation between 1884 and 1888 le chatelier and braun formulated le chatelier's principle which extended the same idea to a more general statement on the effects of factors other than concentration on the position of the equilibrium
