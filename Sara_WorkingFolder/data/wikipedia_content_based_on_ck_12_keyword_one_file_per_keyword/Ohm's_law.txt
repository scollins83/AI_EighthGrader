ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points introducing the constant of proportionality the resistance one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:
where i is the current through the conductor in units of amperes v is the voltage measured across the conductor in units of volts and r is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms more specifically ohm's law states that the r in this relation is constant independent of the current
the law was named after the german physicist georg ohm who in a treatise published in 1827 described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire he presented a slightly more complex equation than the one above (see history section below) to explain his experimental results the above equation is the modern form of ohm's law
in physics the term ohm's law is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law originally formulated by ohm the simplest example of this is:
where j is the current density at a given location in a resistive material e is the electric field at that location and (sigma) is a material-dependent parameter called the conductivity this reformulation of ohm's law is due to gustav kirchhoff
== historyedit ==
in january 1781 before georg ohm's work henry cavendish experimented with leyden jars and glass tubes of varying diameter and length filled with salt solution he measured the current by noting how strong a shock he felt as he completed the circuit with his body cavendish wrote that the "velocity" (current) varied directly as the "degree of electrification" (voltage) he did not communicate his results to other scientists at the time and his results were unknown until maxwell published them in 1879
ohm did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826 and published his results in 1827 as the book die galvanische kette mathematisch bearbeitet ("the galvanic circuit investigated mathematically") he drew considerable inspiration from fourier's work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work for experiments he initially used voltaic piles but later used a thermocouple as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage he used a galvanometer to measure current and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature he then added test wires of varying length diameter and material to complete the circuit he found that his data could be modeled through the equation
where x was the reading from the galvanometer l was the length of the test conductor a depended only on the thermocouple junction temperature and b was a constant of the entire setup from this ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results
ohm's law was probably the most important of the early quantitative descriptions of the physics of electricity we consider it almost obvious today when ohm first published his work this was not the case; critics reacted to his treatment of the subject with hostility they called his work a "web of naked fancies" and the german minister of education proclaimed that "a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science." the prevailing scientific philosophy in germany at the time asserted that experiments need not be performed to develop an understanding of nature because nature is so well ordered and that scientific truths may be deduced through reasoning alone also ohm's brother martin a mathematician was battling the german educational system these factors hindered the acceptance of ohm's work and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s fortunately ohm received recognition for his contributions to science well before he died
in the 1850s ohm's law was known as such and was widely considered proved and alternatives such as "barlow's law" were discredited in terms of real applications to telegraph system design as discussed by samuel f b morse in 1855
while the old term for electrical conductance the mho (the inverse of the resistance unit ohm) is still used a new name the siemens was adopted in 1971 honoring ernst werner von siemens the siemens is preferred in formal papers
in the 1920s it was discovered that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations which depend on temperature even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation now known as johnsonnyquist noise is due to the discrete nature of charge this thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of v/i that fluctuate from the value of r implied by the time average or ensemble average of the measured current; ohm's law remains correct for the average current in the case of ordinary resistive materials
ohm's work long preceded maxwell's equations and any understanding of frequency-dependent effects in ac circuits modern developments in electromagnetic theory and circuit theory do not contradict ohm's law when they are evaluated within the appropriate limits
== scopeedit ==
ohm's law is an empirical law a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials it is less fundamental than maxwell's equations and is not always obeyed any given material will break down under a strong-enough electric field and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are "non-ohmic" under weak fields
ohm's law has been observed on a wide range of length scales in the early 20th century it was thought that ohm's law would fail at the atomic scale but experiments have not borne out this expectation as of 2012 researchers have demonstrated that ohm's law works for silicon wires as small as four atoms wide and one atom high
== microscopic originsedit ==
the dependence of the current density on the applied electric field is essentially quantum mechanical in nature; (see classical and quantum conductivity.) a qualitative description leading to ohm's law can be based upon classical mechanics using the drude model developed by paul drude in 1900
the drude model treats electrons (or other charge carriers) like pinballs bouncing among the ions that make up the structure of the material electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location with each collision though the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field the net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field
the drift velocity then determines the electric current density and its relationship to e and is independent of the collisions drude calculated the average drift velocity from p = ee where p is the average momentum e is the charge of the electron and is the average time between the collisions since both the momentum and the current density are proportional to the drift velocity the current density becomes proportional to the applied electric field; this leads to ohm's law
== hydraulic analogyedit ==
a hydraulic analogy is sometimes used to describe ohm's law water pressure measured by pascals (or psi) is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow water flow rate as in liters per second is the analog of current as in coulombs per second finally flow restrictorssuch as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measuredare the analog of resistors we say that the rate of water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor similarly the rate of flow of electrical charge that is the electric current through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor
flow and pressure variables can be calculated in fluid flow network with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy the method can be applied to both steady and transient flow situations in the linear laminar flow region poiseuille's law describes the hydraulic resistance of a pipe but in the turbulent flow region the pressureflow relations become nonlinear
the hydraulic analogy to ohm's law has been used for example to approximate blood flow through the circulatory system
== circuit analysisedit ==
in circuit analysis three equivalent expressions of ohm's law are used interchangeably:
each equation is quoted by some sources as the defining relationship of ohm's law or all three are quoted or derived from a proportional form or even just the two that do not correspond to ohm's original statement may sometimes be given
the interchangeability of the equation may be represented by a triangle where v (voltage) is placed on the top section the i (current) is placed to the left section and the r (resistance) is placed to the right the line that divides the left and right sections indicate multiplication and the divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar)
=== resistive circuitsedit ===
resistors are circuit elements that impede the passage of electric charge in agreement with ohm's law and are designed to have a specific resistance value r in a schematic diagram the resistor is shown as a zig-zag symbol an element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to ohm's law over some operating range is referred to as an ohmic device (or an ohmic resistor) because ohm's law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range
ohm's law holds for circuits containing only resistive elements (no capacitances or inductances) for all forms of driving voltage or current regardless of whether the driving voltage or current is constant (dc) or time-varying such as ac at any instant of time ohm's law is valid for such circuits
resistors which are in series or in parallel may be grouped together into a single "equivalent resistance" in order to apply ohm's law in analyzing the circuit
=== reactive circuits with time-varying signalsedit ===
when reactive elements such as capacitors inductors or transmission lines are involved in a circuit to which ac or time-varying voltage or current is applied the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a differential equation so ohm's law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value r not complex impedances which may contain capacitance ("c") or inductance ("l")
equations for time-invariant ac circuits take the same form as ohm's law however the variables are generalized to complex numbers and the current and voltage waveforms are complex exponentials
in this approach a voltage or current waveform takes the form  where t is time s is a complex parameter and a is a complex scalar in any linear time-invariant system all of the currents and voltages can be expressed with the same s parameter as the input to the system allowing the time-varying complex exponential term to be canceled out and the system described algebraically in terms of the complex scalars in the current and voltage waveforms
the complex generalization of resistance is impedance usually denoted z; it can be shown that for an inductor
and for a capacitor
we can now write
where v and i are the complex scalars in the voltage and current respectively and z is the complex impedance
this form of ohm's law with z taking the place of r generalizes the simpler form when z is complex only the real part is responsible for dissipating heat
in the general ac circuit z varies strongly with the frequency parameter s and so also will the relationship between voltage and current
for the common case of a steady sinusoid the s parameter is taken to be  corresponding to a complex sinusoid  the real parts of such complex current and voltage waveforms describe the actual sinusoidal currents and voltages in a circuit which can be in different phases due to the different complex scalars
=== linear approximationsedit ===
ohm's law is one of the basic equations used in the analysis of electrical circuits it applies to both metal conductors and circuit components (resistors) specifically made for this behaviour both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering materials and components that obey ohm's law are described as "ohmic" which means they produce the same value for resistance (r = v/i) regardless of the value of v or i which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is dc (direct current) of either positive or negative polarity or ac (alternating current)
in a true ohmic device the same value of resistance will be calculated from r = v/i regardless of the value of the applied voltage v that is the ratio of v/i is constant and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is linear (a straight line) if voltage is forced to some value v then that voltage v divided by measured current i will equal r or if the current is forced to some value i then the measured voltage v divided by that current i is also r since the plot of i versus v is a straight line then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages v1 and v2 applied across a given device of resistance r producing currents i1 = v1/r and i2 = v2/r that the ratio (v1-v2)/(i1-i2) is also a constant equal to r the operator "delta" () is used to represent a difference in a quantity so we can write v = v1-v2 and i = i1-i2 summarizing for any truly ohmic device having resistance r v/i = v/i = r for any applied voltage or current or for the difference between any set of applied voltages or currents
there are however components of electrical circuits which do not obey ohm's law; that is their relationship between current and voltage (their iv curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic) an example is the p-n junction diode (curve at right) as seen in the figure the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode one can determine a value of current (i) for a given value of applied voltage (v) from the curve but not from ohm's law since the value of "resistance" is not constant as a function of applied voltage further the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive not negative the ratio v/i for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static or chordal or dc resistance but as seen in the figure the value of total v over total i varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen this means the "dc resistance" v/i at some point on the curve is not the same as what would be determined by applying an ac signal having peak amplitude v volts or i amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring v/i however in some diode applications the ac signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic small-signal or incremental resistance defined as the one over the slope of the vi curve at the average value (dc operating point) of the voltage (that is one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage) for sufficiently small signals the dynamic resistance allows the ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the v-i curve at the dc operating point
== temperature effectsedit ==
ohm's law has sometimes been stated as "for a conductor in a given state the electromotive force is proportional to the current produced." that is that the resistance the ratio of the applied electromotive force (or voltage) to the current "does not vary with the current strength " the qualifier "in a given state" is usually interpreted as meaning "at a constant temperature," since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent because the conduction of current is related to joule heating of the conducting body according to joule's first law the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current the dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup making the law in this form difficult to directly verify maxwell and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876 controlling for heating effects
== relation to heat conductionsedit ==
ohm's principle predicts the flow of electrical charge (i.e current) in electrical conductors when subjected to the influence of voltage differences; jean-baptiste-joseph fourier's principle predicts the flow of heat in heat conductors when subjected to the influence of temperature differences
the same equation describes both phenomena the equation's variables taking on different meanings in the two cases specifically solving a heat conduction (fourier) problem with temperature (the driving "force") and flux of heat (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity" i.e heat energy) variables also solves an analogous electrical conduction (ohm) problem having electric potential (the driving "force") and electric current (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity" i.e charge) variables
the basis of fourier's work was his clear conception and definition of thermal conductivity he assumed that all else being the same the flux of heat is strictly proportional to the gradient of temperature although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients strictly proportional behavior will be lost when real materials (e.g ones having a thermal conductivity that is a function of temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients
a similar assumption is made in the statement of ohm's law: other things being alike the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential the accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested using modern measurement methods for the electrical case than for the heat case
== other versionsedit ==
ohm's law in the form above is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage current and resistance are interrelated on a "macroscopic" level that is commonly as circuit elements in an electrical circuit physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general vector equation sometimes also referred to as ohm's law having variables that are closely related to the v i and r scalar variables of ohm's law but which are each functions of position within the conductor physicists often use this continuum form of ohm's law:
where "e" is the electric field vector with units of volts per meter (analogous to "v" of ohm's law which has units of volts) "j" is the current density vector with units of amperes per unit area (analogous to "i" of ohm's law which has units of amperes) and "" (greek "rho") is the resistivity with units of ohmmeters (analogous to "r" of ohm's law which has units of ohms) the above equation is sometimes written as j = e where "" (greek "sigma") is the conductivity which is the reciprocal of 
the voltage between two points is defined as:
with the element of path along the integration of electric field vector e if the applied e field is uniform and oriented along the length of the conductor as shown in the figure then defining the voltage v in the usual convention of being opposite in direction to the field (see figure) and with the understanding that the voltage v is measured differentially across the length of the conductor allowing us to drop the symbol the above vector equation reduces to the scalar equation:
since the e field is uniform in the direction of wire length for a conductor having uniformly consistent resistivity  the current density j will also be uniform in any cross-sectional area and oriented in the direction of wire length so we may write:
substituting the above 2 results (for e and j respectively) into the continuum form shown at the beginning of this section:
the electrical resistance of a uniform conductor is given in terms of resistivity by:
where l is the length of the conductor in si units of meters a is the cross-sectional area (for a round wire a = r2 if r is radius) in units of meters squared and is the resistivity in units of ohmmeters
after substitution of r from the above equation into the equation preceding it the continuum form of ohm's law for a uniform field (and uniform current density) oriented along the length of the conductor reduces to the more familiar form:
a perfect crystal lattice with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure would have no resistivity but a real metal has crystallographic defects impurities multiple isotopes and thermal motion of the atoms electrons scatter from all of these resulting in resistance to their flow
the more complex generalized forms of ohm's law are important to condensed matter physics which studies the properties of matter and in particular its electronic structure in broad terms they fall under the topic of constitutive equations and the theory of transport coefficients
=== magnetic effectsedit ===
if an external b-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity v then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the lorentz force on the charge carriers
in the rest frame of the moving conductor this term drops out because v= 0 there is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the e-field in the lab frame: e ' = e + vb electric and magnetic fields are relative see lorentz transformation
if the current j is alternating because the applied voltage or e-field varies in time then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance see electrical impedance the reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled
=== conductive fluidsedit ===
in a conductive fluid such as a plasma there is a similar effect consider a fluid moving with the velocity in a magnetic field  the relative motion induces an electric field which exerts electric force on the charged particles giving rise to an electric current  the equation of motion for the electron gas with a number density is written as
where  and are the charge mass and velocity of the electrons respectively also is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field  since the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write
where we have used the definition of the current density and also put which is the electrical conductivity this equation can also be equivalently written as
where is the electrical resistivity it is also common to write instead of which can be confusing since it is the same notation used for the magnetic diffusivity defined as
