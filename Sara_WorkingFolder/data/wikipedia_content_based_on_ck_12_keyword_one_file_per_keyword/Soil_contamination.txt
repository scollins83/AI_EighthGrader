soil contamination or soil pollution as part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment it is typically caused by industrial activity agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste the most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene) solvents pesticides lead and other heavy metals contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical usage
the concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks from direct contact with the contaminated soil vapors from the contaminants and from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting cleanup are time consuming and expensive tasks requiring extensive amounts of geology hydrology chemistry computer modeling skills and gis in environmental contamination as well as an appreciation of the history of industrial chemistry
in north america and western europe the extent of contaminated land is best known with many of countries in these areas having a legal framework to identify and deal with this environmental problem developing countries tend to be less tightly regulated despite some of them having undergone significant industrialization
== causes ==
soil pollution can be caused by the following (non-exhaustive list!):
oil drilling
mining and activities by other heavy industries
accidental spills as may happen during deforestation activities etc
corrosion of underground storage tanks (including piping used to transmit the contents)
acid rain (in turn caused by air pollution)
intensive farming
agrochemicals such as pesticides herbicides and fertilizers
industrial accidents
road debris
drainage of contaminated surface water into the soil
waste disposal
oil and fuel dumping
nuclear wastes
direct discharge of industrial wastes to the soil
landfill and illegal dumping
coal ash
electronic waste
ammunitions and agents of war
the most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons solvents pesticides lead and other heavy metals
in a wider sense genetically modified plants (gmp) can count as a risk factor for soils because of their potential to affect the soil fauna any activity that leads to other forms of soil degradation (erosion compaction etc.) may indirectly worsen the contamination effects in that soil remediation becomes more tedious
historical deposition of coal ash used for residential commercial and industrial heating as well as for industrial processes such as ore smelting were a common source of contamination in areas that were industrialized before about 1960 coal naturally concentrates lead and zinc during its formation as well as other heavy metals to a lesser degree when the coal is burned most of these metals become concentrated in the ash (the principal exception being mercury) coal ash and slag may contain sufficient lead to qualify as a "characteristic hazardous waste" defined in the usa as containing more than 5 mg/l of extractable lead using the tclp procedure in addition to lead coal ash typically contains variable but significant concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs; e.g. benzo(a)anthracene benzo(b)fluoranthene benzo(k)fluoranthene benzo(a)pyrene indeno(cd)pyrene phenanthrene anthracene and others) these pahs are known human carcinogens and the acceptable concentrations of them in soil are typically around 1 mg/kg coal ash and slag can be recognised by the presence of off-white grains in soil gray heterogeneous soil or (coal slag) bubbly vesicular pebble-sized grains
treated sewage sludge known in the industry as biosolids has become controversial as a "fertilizer" as it is the byproduct of sewage treatment it generally contains more contaminants such as organisms pesticides and heavy metals than other soil
in the european union the urban waste water treatment directive allows sewage sludge to be sprayed onto land the volume is expected to double to 185,000 tons of dry solids in 2005 this has good agricultural properties due to the high nitrogen and phosphate content in 1990/1991 13% wet weight was sprayed onto 0.13% of the land; however this is expected to rise 15 fold by 2005 advocates say there is a need to control this so that pathogenic microorganisms do not get into water courses and to ensure that there is no accumulation of heavy metals in the top soil
=== pesticides and herbicides ===
a pesticide is a substance or mixture of substances used to kill a pest a pesticide may be a chemical substance biological agent (such as a virus or bacteria) antimicrobial disinfectant or device used against any pest pests include insects plant pathogens weeds mollusks birds mammals fish nematodes (roundworms) and microbes that compete with humans for food destroy property spread or are a vector for disease or cause a nuisance although there are benefits to the use of pesticides there are also drawbacks such as potential toxicity to humans and other organisms
herbicides are used to kill weeds especially on pavements and railways they are similar to auxins and most are biodegradable by soil bacteria however one group derived from trinitrotoluene (2:4 d and 2:4:5 t) have the impurity dioxin which is very toxic and causes fatality even in low concentrations another herbicide is paraquat it is highly toxic but it rapidly degrades in soil due to the action of bacteria and does not kill soil fauna
insecticides are used to rid farms of pests which damage crops the insects damage not only standing crops but also stored ones and in the tropics it is reckoned that one third of the total production is lost during food storage as with fungicides the first insecticides used in the nineteenth century were inorganic e.g paris green and other compounds of arsenic nicotine has also been used since the late eighteenth century
there are now two main groups of synthetic insecticides -
1 organochlorines include ddt aldrin dieldrin and bhc they are cheap to produce potent and persistent ddt was used on a massive scale from the 1930s with a peak of 72,000 tonnes used 1970 then usage fell as the harmful environmental effects were realized it was found worldwide in fish and birds and was even discovered in the snow in the antarctic it is only slightly soluble in water but is very soluble in the bloodstream it affects the nervous and endocrine systems and causes the eggshells of birds to lack calcium causing them to be easily breakable it is thought to be responsible for the decline of the numbers of birds of prey like ospreys and peregrine falcons in the 1950s - they are now recovering as well as increased concentration via the food chain it is known to enter via permeable membranes so fish get it through their gills as it has low water solubility it tends to stay at the water surface so organisms that live there are most affected ddt found in fish that formed part of the human food chain caused concern but the levels found in the liver kidney and brain tissues was less than 1 ppm and in fat was 10 ppm which was below the level likely to cause harm however ddt was banned in the uk and the united states to stop the further buildup of it in the food chain u.s manufacturers continued to sell ddt to developing countries who could not afford the expensive replacement chemicals and who did not have such stringent regulations governing the use of pesticides
2 organophosphates e.g parathion methyl parathion and about 40 other insecticides are available nationally parathion is highly toxic methyl-parathion is less so and malathion is generally considered safe as it has low toxicity and is rapidly broken down in the mammalian liver this group works by preventing normal nerve transmission as cholinesterase is prevented from breaking down the transmitter substance acetylcholine resulting in uncontrolled muscle movements
=== agents of war ===
the disposal of munitions and a lack of care in manufacture of munitions caused by the urgency of production can contaminate soil for extended periods there is little published evidence on this type of contamination largely because of restrictions placed by governments of many countries on the publication of material related to war effort however mustard gas stored during world war ii has contaminated some sites for up to 50 years and the testing of anthrax as a potential biological weapon contaminated the whole island of gruinard
== health effects ==
contaminated or polluted soil directly affects human health through direct contact with soil or via inhalation of soil contaminants which have vaporized; potentially greater threats are posed by the infiltration of soil contamination into groundwater aquifers used for human consumption sometimes in areas apparently far removed from any apparent source of above ground contamination
health consequences from exposure to soil contamination vary greatly depending on pollutant type pathway of attack and vulnerability of the exposed population chronic exposure to chromium lead and other metals petroleum solvents and many pesticide and herbicide formulations can be carcinogenic can cause congenital disorders or can cause other chronic health conditions industrial or man-made concentrations of naturally occurring substances such as nitrate and ammonia associated with livestock manure from agricultural operations have also been identified as health hazards in soil and groundwater
chronic exposure to benzene at sufficient concentrations is known to be associated with higher incidence of leukemia mercury and cyclodienes are known to induce higher incidences of kidney damage and some irreversible diseases pcbs and cyclodienes are linked to liver toxicity organophosphates and carbomates can induce a chain of responses leading to neuromuscular blockage many chlorinated solvents induce liver changes kidney changes and depression of the central nervous system there is an entire spectrum of further health effects such as headache nausea fatigue eye irritation and skin rash for the above cited and other chemicals at sufficient dosages a large number of soil contaminants can cause death by exposure via direct contact inhalation or ingestion of contaminants in groundwater contaminated through soil
the scottish government has commissioned the institute of occupational medicine to undertake a review of methods to assess risk to human health from contaminated land the overall aim of the project is to work up guidance that should be useful to scottish local authorities in assessing whether sites represent a significant possibility of significant harm (sposh) to human health it is envisaged that the output of the project will be a short document providing high level guidance on health risk assessment with reference to existing published guidance and methodologies that have been identified as being particularly relevant and helpful the project will examine how policy guidelines have been developed for determining the acceptability of risks to human health and propose an approach for assessing what constitutes unacceptable risk in line with the criteria for sposh as defined in the legislation and the scottish statutory guidance
== ecosystem effects ==
not unexpectedly soil contaminants can have significant deleterious consequences for ecosystems there are radical soil chemistry changes which can arise from the presence of many hazardous chemicals even at low concentration of the contaminant species these changes can manifest in the alteration of metabolism of endemic microorganisms and arthropods resident in a given soil environment the result can be virtual eradication of some of the primary food chain which in turn could have major consequences for predator or consumer species even if the chemical effect on lower life forms is small the lower pyramid levels of the food chain may ingest alien chemicals which normally become more concentrated for each consuming rung of the food chain many of these effects are now well known such as the concentration of persistent ddt materials for avian consumers leading to weakening of egg shells increased chick mortality and potential extinction of species
effects occur to agricultural lands which have certain types of soil contamination contaminants typically alter plant metabolism often causing a reduction in crop yields this has a secondary effect upon soil conservation since the languishing crops cannot shield the earth's soil from erosion some of these chemical contaminants have long half-lives and in other cases derivative chemicals are formed from decay of primary soil contaminants
== cleanup options ==
cleanup or environmental remediation is analyzed by environmental scientists who utilize field measurement of soil chemicals and also apply computer models (gis in environmental contamination) for analyzing transport and fate of soil chemicals various technologies have been developed for remediation of oil-contaminated soil/ sediments there are several principal strategies for remediation:
excavate soil and take it to a disposal site away from ready pathways for human or sensitive ecosystem contact this technique also applies to dredging of bay muds containing toxins
aeration of soils at the contaminated site (with attendant risk of creating air pollution)
thermal remediation by introduction of heat to raise subsurface temperatures sufficiently high to volatize chemical contaminants out of the soil for vapour extraction technologies include istd electrical resistance heating (erh) and et-dsptm
bioremediation involving microbial digestion of certain organic chemicals techniques used in bioremediation include landfarming biostimulation and bioaugmentating soil biota with commercially available microflora
extraction of groundwater or soil vapor with an active electromechanical system with subsequent stripping of the contaminants from the extract
containment of the soil contaminants (such as by capping or paving over in place)
phytoremediation or using plants (such as willow) to extract heavy metals
mycoremediation or using fungus to metabolize contaminants and accumulate heavy metals
== by country ==
various national standards for concentrations of particular contaminants include the united states epa region 9 preliminary remediation goals (u.s prgs) the u.s epa region 3 risk based concentrations (u.s epa rbcs) and national environment protection council of australia guideline on investigation levels in soil and groundwater
=== people's republic of china ===
the immense and sustained growth of the people's republic of china since the 1970s has exacted a price from the land in increased soil pollution the state environmental protection administration believes it to be a threat to the environment to food safety and to sustainable agriculture according to a scientific sampling 150 million mi (100,000 square kilometers) of chinas cultivated land have been polluted with contaminated water being used to irrigate a further 31.5 million mi (21,670 km2.) and another 2 million mi (1,300 square kilometers) covered or destroyed by solid waste in total the area accounts for one-tenth of chinas cultivatable land and is mostly in economically developed areas an estimated 12 million tonnes of grain are contaminated by heavy metals every year causing direct losses of 20 billion yuan (us$2.57 billion)
=== united kingdom ===
generic guidance commonly used in the united kingdom are the soil guideline values published by the department for environment food and rural affairs (defra) and the environment agency these are screening values that demonstrate the minimal acceptable level of a substance above this there can be no assurances in terms of significant risk of harm to human health these have been derived using the contaminated land exposure assessment model (clea uk) certain input parameters such as health criteria values age and land use are fed into clea uk to obtain a probabilistic output
guidance by the inter departmental committee for the redevelopment of contaminated land (icrcl) has been formally withdrawn by defra for use as a prescriptive document to determine the potential need for remediation or further assessment
the clea model published by defra and the environment agency (ea) in march 2002 sets a framework for the appropriate assessment of risks to human health from contaminated land as required by part iia of the environmental protection act 1990 as part of this framework generic soil guideline values (sgvs) have currently been derived for ten contaminants to be used as "intervention values" these values should not be considered as remedial targets but values above which further detailed assessment should be considered; see dutch standards
three sets of clea sgvs have been produced for three different land uses namely
residential (with and without plant uptake)
allotments
commercial/industrial
it is intended that the sgvs replace the former icrcl values it should be noted that the clea sgvs relate to assessing chronic (long term) risks to human health and do not apply to the protection of ground workers during construction or other potential receptors such as groundwater buildings plants or other ecosystems the clea sgvs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils
to date the first ten of fifty-five contaminant sgvs have been published for the following: arsenic cadmium chromium lead inorganic mercury nickel selenium ethyl benzene phenol and toluene draft sgvs for benzene naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold toxicological data (tox) has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzo[a]pyrene benzene dioxins furans and dioxin-like pcbs naphthalene vinyl chloride 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2 tetrachloroethane 1,1,1 trichloroethane tetrachloroethene carbon tetrachloride 1,2-dichloroethane trichloroethene and xylene the sgvs for ethyl benzene phenol and toluene are dependent on the soil organic matter (som) content (which can be calculated from the total organic carbon (toc) content) as an initial screen the sgvs for 1% som are considered to be appropriate

in march 2009 the issue of uranium poisoning in punjab attracted press coverage it was alleged to be caused by fly ash ponds of thermal power stations which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the faridkot and bhatinda districts of punjab the news reports claimed the uranium levels were more than 60 times the maximum safe limit in 2012 the government of india confirmed that the ground water in malwa belt of punjab has uranium metal that is 50% above the trace limits set by the united nations' world health organization scientific studies based on over 1000 samples from various sampling points could not trace the source to fly ash and any sources from thermal power plants or industry as originally alleged the study also revealed that the uranium concentration in ground water of malwa district is not 60 times the who limits but only 50% above the who limit in 3 locations this highest concentration found in samples was less than those found naturally in ground waters currently used for human purposes elsewhere such as finland research is underway to identify natural or other sources for the uranium
