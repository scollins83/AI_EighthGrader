medical astrology (traditionally known as iatromathematics) is an ancient medical system that associates various parts of the body diseases and drugs as under the influence of the sun moon and planets along with the twelve astrological signs each of the astrological signs (along with the sun moon and planets) is associated with different parts of the human body the underlying basis for medical astrology astrology itself is considered to be a pseudoscience or superstition as there is no scientific basis for its core beliefs
== overview ==
medical astrology posits the association of each sign of the zodiac with parts of the body and was already mentioned by marcus manilius (1st century ad) in his epic poem (8000 verses) astronomica the signs of the zodiac were believed to preside over the parts of the body covering the body from head (aries) to toe (pisces) as follows:
aries head face brain eyes
taurus throat neck thyroid gland vocal tract
gemini arms lungs shoulders hands nervous system brain
cancer chest breasts stomach alimentary canal
leo heart chest spine spinal column upper back
virgo digestive system intestines spleen nervous system
libra kidneys skin lumbar region buttocks
scorpio reproductive system sexual organs bowels excretory system
sagittarius hips thighs liver sciatic nerve
capricorn knees joints skeletal system
aquarius ankles calves circulatory system
pisces feet toes lymphatic system adipose tissue
the western astrology planets are also associated with certain portions and functions within the body:
sun heart spine and general vitality
moon stomach digestive system female organs lymphatic system
mercury brain central nervous system thyroid gland five senses hands
venus throat kidneys thymus gland sense of touch ovaries
mars muscles head adrenal glands senses of smell and taste
jupiter liver thighs feet growth pituitary gland
saturn skin hair teeth bones the body's defenses spleen
uranus parathyroid gland neural activity aura
neptune pineal gland psychic healing
pluto pancreas metabolism elimination
after examining an individual's natal chart a medical astrologer may give advice to the client about the areas of the body in which they are most likely to experience trouble for instance an individual with the sun moon ascendant or many planets in the sign of aries is presumed to have more headaches than other people because of the association of aries with the head a person with taurus strong in the natal chart is predicted to have many sore throats and problems with the voice because of the taurean association with that particular part of the body
