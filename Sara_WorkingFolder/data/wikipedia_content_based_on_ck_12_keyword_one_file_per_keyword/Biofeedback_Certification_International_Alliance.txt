professionals certified by bcia in general biofeedback may refer to themselves as board certified in biofeedback (bcb) in neurofeedback as board certified in neurofeedback (bcn) and pelvic muscle dysfunction biofeedback as board certified in biofeedback for pelvic muscle dysfunction (bcb-pmd) the majority of bcia's international certificants practice in canada europe asia and australia
