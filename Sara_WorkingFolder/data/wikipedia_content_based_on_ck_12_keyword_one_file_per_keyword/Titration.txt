titration also known as titrimetry is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis that is used to determine the unknown concentration of an identified analyte since volume measurements play a key role in titration it is also known as volumetric analysis a reagent called the titrant or titrator is prepared as a standard solution a known concentration and volume of titrant reacts with a solution of analyte or titrand to determine concentration the volume of titrant reacted is called titration volume
== history and etymology ==
the word "titration" comes from the latin word titulus meaning inscription or title the french word titre also from this origin means rank
volumetric analysis originated in late 18th-century france franois-antoine-henri descroizilles (fr) developed the first burette (which was similar to a graduated cylinder) in 1791 joseph louis gay-lussac developed an improved version of the burette that included a side arm and coined the terms "pipette" and "burette" in an 1824 paper on the standardization of indigo solutions a major breakthrough in the methodology and popularization of volumetric analysis was due to karl friedrich mohr who redesigned the burette by placing a clamp and a tip at the bottom and wrote the first textbook on the topic lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen titrirmethode (textbook of analytical-chemical titration methods) published in 1855
== procedure ==
a typical titration begins with a beaker or erlenmeyer flask containing a very precise volume of the analyte and a small amount of indicator (such as phenolphthalein) placed underneath a calibrated burette or chemistry pipetting syringe containing the titrant small volumes of the titrant are then added to the analyte and indicator until the indicator changes color in reaction to the titrant saturation threshold reflecting arrival at the endpoint of the titration depending on the endpoint desired single drops or less than a single drop of the titrant can make the difference between a permanent and temporary change in the indicator when the endpoint of the reaction is reached the volume of reactant consumed is measured and used to calculate the concentration of analyte by
where ca is the concentration of the analyte typically in molarity; ct is the concentration of the titrant typically in molarity; vt is the volume of the titrant used typically in liters; m is the mole ratio of the analyte and reactant from the balanced chemical equation; and va is the volume of the analyte used typically in liters
=== preparation techniques ===
typical titrations require titrant and analyte to be in a liquid (solution) form though solids are usually dissolved into an aqueous solution other solvents such as glacial acetic acid or ethanol are used for special purposes (as in petrochemistry) concentrated analytes are often diluted to improve accuracy
many non-acid-base titrations require a constant ph throughout the reaction therefore a buffer solution may be added to the titration chamber to maintain the ph
in instances where two reactants in a sample may react with the titrant and only one is the desired analyte a separate masking solution may be added to the reaction chamber which masks the unwanted ion
some redox reactions may require heating the sample solution and titrating while the solution is still hot to increase the reaction rate for instance the oxidation of some oxalate solutions requires heating to 60 c (140 f) to maintain a reasonable rate of reaction
== titration curves ==
a titration curve is a curve in the plane whose x-coordinate is the volume of titrant added since the beginning of the titration and whose y-coordinate is the concentration of the analyte at the corresponding stage of the titration (in an acid-base titration the y-coordinate is usually the ph of the solution)
in an acid-base titration the titration curve reflects the strength of the corresponding acid and base for a strong acid and a strong base the curve will be relatively smooth and very steep near the equivalence point because of this a small change in titrant volume near the equivalence point results in a large ph change and many indicators would be appropriate (for instance litmus phenolphthalein or bromothymol blue)
if one reagent is a weak acid or base and the other is a strong acid or base the titration curve is irregular and the ph shifts less with small additions of titrant near the equivalence point for example the titration curve for the titration between oxalic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is pictured the equivalence point occurs between ph 8-10 indicating the solution is basic at the equivalence point and an indicator such as phenolphthalein would be appropriate titration curves corresponding to weak bases and strong acids are similarly behaved with the solution being acidic at the equivalence point and indicators such as methyl orange and bromothymol blue being most appropriate
titrations between a weak acid and a weak base have titration curves which are highly irregular because of this no definite indicator may be appropriate and a ph meter is often used to monitor the reaction
the type of function that can be used to describe the curve is called a sigmoid function
== types of titrations ==
there are many types of titrations with different procedures and goals the most common types of qualitative titration are acid-base titrations and redox titrations
=== acidbase titration ===
acid-base titrations depend on the neutralization between an acid and a base when mixed in solution in addition to the sample an appropriate ph indicator is added to the titration chamber reflecting the ph range of the equivalence point the acid-base indicator indicates the endpoint of the titration by changing color the endpoint and the equivalence point are not exactly the same because the equivalence point is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction while the endpoint is just the color change from the indicator thus a careful selection of the indicator will reduce the indicator error for example if the equivalence point is at a ph of 8.4 then the phenolphthalein indicator would be used instead of alizarin yellow because phenolphthalein would reduce the indicator error common indicators their colors and the ph range in which they change color are given in the table above when more precise results are required or when the reagents are a weak acid and a weak base a ph meter or a conductance meter are used
for very strong bases such as organolithium reagent metal amides and hydrides water is generally not a suitable solvent and indicators whose pka are in the range of aqueous ph changes are of little use instead the titrant and indicator used are much weaker acids and anhydrous solvents such as thf are used
=== redox titration ===
redox titrations are based on a reduction-oxidation reaction between an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent a potentiometer or a redox indicator is usually used to determine the endpoint of the titration as when one of the constituents is the oxidizing agent potassium dichromate the color change of the solution from orange to green is not definite therefore an indicator such as sodium diphenylamine is used analysis of wines for sulfur dioxide requires iodine as an oxidizing agent in this case starch is used as an indicator; a blue starch-iodine complex is formed in the presence of excess iodine signalling the endpoint
some redox titrations do not require an indicator due to the intense color of the constituents for instance in permanganometry a slight persisting pink color signals the endpoint of the titration because of the color of the excess oxidizing agent potassium permanganate in iodometry at sufficiently large concentrations the disappearance of the deep red-brown triiodide ion can itself be used as an endpoint though at lower concentrations sensitivity is improved by adding starch indicator which forms an intensely blue complex with triiodide
=== gas phase titration ===
gas phase titrations are titrations done in the gas phase specifically as methods for determining reactive species by reaction with an excess of some other gas acting as the titrant in one common gas phase titration gaseous ozone is titrated with nitrogen oxide according to the reaction
o3 + no o2 + no2
after the reaction is complete the remaining titrant and product are quantified (e.g. by ft-ir); this is used to determine the amount of analyte in the original sample
gas phase titration has several advantages over simple spectrophotometry first the measurement does not depend on path length because the same path length is used for the measurement of both the excess titrant and the product second the measurement does not depend on a linear change in absorbance as a function of analyte concentration as defined by the beer-lambert law third it is useful for samples containing species which interfere at wavelengths typically used for the analyte
=== complexometric titration ===
complexometric titrations rely on the formation of a complex between the analyte and the titrant in general they require specialized complexometric indicators that form weak complexes with the analyte the commonest example is the use of starch indicator to increase the sensitivity of iodometric titration the dark blue complex of starch with iodine and iodide being more visible than iodine alone other complexometric indicators are eriochrome black t for the titration of calcium and magnesium ions and the chelating agent edta used to titrate metal ions in solution
=== zeta potential titration ===
zeta potential titrations are titrations in which the completion is monitored by the zeta potential rather than by an indicator in order to characterize heterogeneous systems such as colloids one of the uses is to determine the iso-electric point when surface charge becomes zero achieved by changing the ph or adding surfactant another use is to determine the optimum dose for flocculation or stabilization
=== assay ===
an assay is a form of biological titration used to determine the concentration of a virus or bacterium serial dilutions are performed on a sample in a fixed ratio (such as 1:1 1:2 1:4 1:8 etc.) until the last dilution does not give a positive test for the presence of the virus the positive or negative value may be determined by visually inspecting the infected cells under a microscope or by an immunoenzymetric method such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) this value is known as the titer
== measuring the endpoint of a titration ==
different methods to determine the endpoint include:
indicator: a substance that changes color in response to a chemical change an acid-base indicator (e.g. phenolphthalein) changes color depending on the ph redox indicators are also used a drop of indicator solution is added to the titration at the beginning; the endpoint has been reached when the color changes
potentiometer: an instrument that measures the electrode potential of the solution these are used for redox titrations; the potential of the working electrode will suddenly change as the endpoint is reached
ph meter: a potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of h+ ion present in the solution (this is an example of an ion-selective electrode.) the ph of the solution is measured throughout the titration more accurately than with an indicator; at the endpoint there will be a sudden change in the measured ph
conductivity: a measurement of ions in a solution ion concentration can change significantly in a titration which changes the conductivity (for instance during an acid-base titration the h+ and oh ions react to form neutral h2o.) as total conductance depends on all ions present in the solution and not all ions contribute equally (due to mobility and ionic strength) predicting the change in conductivity is more difficult than measuring it
color change: in some reactions the solution changes color without any added indicator this is often seen in redox titrations when the different oxidation states of the product and reactant produce different colors
precipitation: if a reaction produces a solid a precipitate will form during the titration a classic example is the reaction between ag+ and cl to form the insoluble salt agcl cloudy precipitates usually make it difficult to determine the endpoint precisely to compensate precipitation titrations often have to be done as "back" titrations (see below)
isothermal titration calorimeter: an instrument that measures the heat produced or consumed by the reaction to determine the endpoint used in biochemical titrations such as the determination of how substrates bind to enzymes
thermometric titrimetry: differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry because the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution instead the endpoint is determined by the rate of temperature change
spectroscopy: used to measure the absorption of light by the solution during titration if the spectrum of the reactant titrant or product is known the concentration of the material can be determined by beer's law
amperometry: measures the current produced by the titration reaction as a result of the oxidation or reduction of the analyte the endpoint is detected as a change in the current this method is most useful when the excess titrant can be reduced as in the titration of halides with ag+
=== endpoint and equivalence point ===
though equivalence point and endpoint are used interchangeably they are different terms equivalence point is the theoretical completion of the reaction: the volume of added titrant at which the number of moles of titrant is equal to the number of moles of analyte or some multiple thereof (as in polyprotic acids) endpoint is what is actually measured a physical change in the solution as determined by an indicator or an instrument mentioned above
there is a slight difference between the endpoint and the equivalence point of the titration this error is referred to as an indicator error and it is indeterminate
=== back titration ===
back titration is a titration done in reverse; instead of titrating the original sample a known excess of standard reagent is added to the solution and the excess is titrated a back titration is useful if the endpoint of the reverse titration is easier to identify than the endpoint of the normal titration as with precipitation reactions back titrations are also useful if the reaction between the analyte and the titrant is very slow or when the analyte is in a non-soluble solid
== graphical methods ==
the titration process creates solutions with compositions ranging from pure acid to pure base identifying the ph associated with any stage in the titration process is relatively simple for monoprotic acids and bases the presence of more than one acid or base group complicates these computations graphical methods such as the equiligraph have long been used to account for the interaction of coupled equilibria these graphical solution methods are simple to implement however they are infrequently used
== particular uses ==
specific examples of titrations include:
acid-base titrations
in biodiesel: waste vegetable oil (wvo) must be neutralized before a batch may be processed a portion of wvo is titrated with a base to determine acidity so the rest of the batch may be properly neutralized this removes free fatty acids from the wvo that would normally react to make soap instead of biodiesel
kjeldahl method: a measure of nitrogen content in a sample organic nitrogen is digested into ammonia with sulfuric acid and potassium sulfate finally ammonia is back titrated with boric acid and then sodium carbonate
acid value: the mass in milligrams of potassium hydroxide (koh) required to titrate fully an acid in one gram of sample an example is the determination of free fatty acid content
saponification value: the mass in milligrams of koh required to saponify a fatty acid in one gram of sample saponification is used to determine average chain length of fatty acids in fat
ester value (or ester index): a calculated index ester value = saponification value acid value
amine value: the mass in milligrams of koh equal to the amine content in one gram of sample
hydroxyl value: the mass in milligrams of koh corresponding to hydroxyl groups in one gram of sample the analyte is acetylated using acetic anhydride then titrated with koh
redox titrations
winkler test for dissolved oxygen: used to determine oxygen concentration in water oxygen in water samples is reduced using manganese(ii) sulfate which reacts with potassium iodide to produce iodine the iodine is released in proportion to the oxygen in the sample thus the oxygen concentration is determined with a redox titration of iodine with thiosulfate using a starch indicator
vitamin c: also known as ascorbic acid vitamin c is a powerful reducing agent its concentration can easily be identified when titrated with the blue dye dichlorophenolindophenol (dcpip) which turns colorless when reduced by the vitamin
benedict's reagent: excess glucose in urine may indicate diabetes in the patient benedict's method is the conventional method to quantify glucose in urine using a prepared reagent in this titration glucose reduces cupric ions to cuprous ions which react with potassium thiocyanate to produce a white precipitate indicating the endpoint
bromine number: a measure of unsaturation in an analyte expressed in milligrams of bromine absorbed by 100 grams of sample
iodine number: a measure of unsaturation in an analyte expressed in grams of iodine absorbed by 100 grams of sample
miscellaneous
karl fischer titration: a potentiometric method to analyze trace amounts of water in a substance a sample is dissolved in methanol and titrated with karl fischer reagent the reagent contains iodine which reacts proportionally with water thus the water content can be determined by monitoring the potential of excess iodine
