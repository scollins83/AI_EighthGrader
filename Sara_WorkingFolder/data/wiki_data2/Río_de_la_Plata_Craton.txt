The Ro de la Plata Craton is one of the five cratons (ancient nuclei) of the South American continent. The other four cratons are: Amazonian, So Francisco, Ro Apa and ArequipaAntofalla.
It crops out in southern Uruguay and parts of Argentina. Crystalline rocks of the Ro de la Plata Craton are dated between 2200 and 1700 million years ago, such as rocks in Uruguay which are dated at 1790 5 Ma. Dikes trending ENE in the same area are dated by argon-argon dating at 1727 10 Ma. The craton has a size of about 20,000 square kilometres.
