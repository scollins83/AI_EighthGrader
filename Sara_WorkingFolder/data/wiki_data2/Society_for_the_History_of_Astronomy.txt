The Society for the History of Astronomy is an organisation based in the United Kingdom that promotes research into the history of astronomy. It publishes a research journal called The Antiquarian Astronomer and a regular Bulletin.


== The Society ==
The Society for the History of Astronomy was founded in 2002 to promote the study of the history of astronomy by hosting talks by members and publishing new research into the field. One main objective was to encourage research into past astronomers who have previously been neglected within the history of science. Some of its members are professional historians of science but most are amateur historians.
The Honorary President is Dr Allan Chapman of Wadham College, Oxford. The honorary vice-presidents are Dr Michael Hoskin of Churchill College, Cambridge, and Sir Arnold Wolfendale, FRS. Sir Patrick Moore was an honorary vice-president until his death in 2012.
The Society hosts several one-day conferences at venues across the United Kingdom each year. A Bulletin is published twice yearly containing articles and news items about astronomical history. The Bulletin includes short reports of original research by members.
The society maintains a library of publications of importance to the history of science. It is known as the Sir Robert Ball Library and is located at the Birmingham and Midland Institute in central Birmingham. The archives of the Society are preserved at the Library of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge.


== Survey of Astronomical History ==
One of the Society's major activities is organising a Survey of Astronomical History in the form of lists of historical astronomers and observatories in each of the old counties of Britain and Ireland. This has been motivated by a desire to promote research into local astronomical activities that have previously been neglected.


== The Antiquarian Astronomer ==
The Society publishes annually a refereed journal called The Antiquarian Astronomer containing new research into the history of astronomy, particularly articles written by members. Published papers have discussed activities in major observatories, scientific research by individuals of particular note, scientific instrument makers, and the activities of prominent amateur astronomers.
The first issue appeared in 2004, and issue 9 was published in 2015. Back issues are indexed in the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), and the ADS contains scans of all articles published during the period 20042012.


== Society for the History of Astronomy Bulletin ==
The Society publishes an occasional Bulletin containing news relating to the study of the history of astronomy and the organisation's activities. The Bulletin also includes short research articles and notes by members. It was previously called News (editions 14, 20022004) and Newsletter (editions 517, 20042008). Articles are indexed in the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System but scans are not currently available.
