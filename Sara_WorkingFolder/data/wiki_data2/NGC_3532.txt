NGC 3532, also known as the Football Cluster, and the Black Arrow Cluster, is an open cluster in the constellation Carina, lies some 1,321 light years away. It consists of approximately 150 stars of 7th magnitude or fainter, including seven red giants and seven white dwarfs. On 20 May 1990 it became the first target ever observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. A line from Beta Crucis through Delta Crucis passes somewhat to the north of NCG 3532. The cluster lies between the constellation Crux and the larger but fainter "False Cross" asterism. The 4th-magnitude Cepheid variable star x Carinae (V382 Carinae) is the nearest naked-eye star, but it is not a member of the cluster. NGC 3532 lies near the Eta Carinae nebula (NGC 3372) and several other prominent open clusters like NGC 3293 and IC 2581.
The cluster was first catalogued by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751. It was admired by John Herschel, who thought it one of the finest irregular clusters in the sky, with many double stars (binary stars).
