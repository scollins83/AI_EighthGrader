The Domuyo Volcano is a stratovolcano located in the Argentine province of Neuqun. With a height of 4,709 m (15,449 ft), it is the highest mountain in Patagonia and is sometimes called the "Roof of Patagonia" ("El Techo de la Patagonia" in Spanish).
The volcano has a large 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide caldera. At least 14 dacite lava domes are found within the caldera, with another five outside. Its slopes contain many fumaroles, hot springs and geysers.
It names derives from the Mapuche meaning "To tremble and grumble", probably due to the geothermal activity of the volcano.
The volcano is accessible by the National Route 40 from Chos Malal, connecting with provincial route 43, passing by Andacollo.
