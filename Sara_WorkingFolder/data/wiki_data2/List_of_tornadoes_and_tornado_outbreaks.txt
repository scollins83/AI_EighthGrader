== Tornado events by location ==
These are some notable tornadoes, tornado outbreaks, and tornado outbreak sequences that have occurred around the globe.
Exact death and injury counts are not possible; especially for large events and events before 1955.
Prior to 1950 in the United States, only significant tornadoes are listed for the number of tornadoes in outbreaks.
Due to increasing detection, particularly in the U.S., numbers of counted tornadoes have increased markedly in recent decades although the number of actual tornadoes and counted significant tornadoes has not. In older events, the number of tornadoes officially counted is likely underestimated.

=== Europe ===


=== Asia ===


=== Southern Hemisphere ===

For purposes of the list, all of Africa is included as within the Southern Hemisphere and the Arabian Peninsula is included within Southwest Asia.
