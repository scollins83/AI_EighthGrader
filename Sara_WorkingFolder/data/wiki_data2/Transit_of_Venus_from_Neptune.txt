A transit of Venus from Neptune occurs when Venus appears to pass in front of the Sun as seen from Neptune.
The mutual inclination of the two orbits is 2.79, and the synodic period is 226 days. There are 10, 11, or 12 transits of Venus occurring one synodic period apart, followed by a gap of 123 such periods.
