In astrophysics self-interacting dark matter is a hypothetical form of dark matter consisting of particles with strong self-interactions. This type of dark matter was postulated to resolve a number of conflicts between observations and simulations on the galactic scale and smaller.  Self-interacting dark matter has also been postulated as an explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal.
