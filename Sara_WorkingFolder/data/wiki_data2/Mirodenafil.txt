Mirodenafil belongs to a class of drugs called PDE5 inhibitors, which many other erectile dysfunction drugs such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil also belong to. It was developed by SK Chemicals Life Science and is marketed in Korea under the trade name of Mvix tab which comes in different doses (50 mg, 100 mg).
Mirodenafil is also available under the name of Mvix S ODF 50 mg as an orally dissolving film (ODF) which dissolves on the tongue without water. It is the first licensed medicine for the treatment of erectile dysfunction as a dosage form of film.
Several clinical trials were conducted, but mirodenafil has not been approved for use in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
