The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS; Chinese: ), with roots in the Academia Sinica of the Republic of China, is the national academy for the natural sciences of China. Collectively known as the "Two Academies ()" along with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, it is an institution of China, functioning as the national scientific think tank and academic governing body, providing advisory and appraisal services on issues stemming from the national economy, social development, and science and technology progress. It is headquartered in Beijing, with branch institutes all over mainland China. It has also created hundreds of commercial enterprises, with Lenovo being one of the most famous.


== Organization ==

The Chinese Academy has its roots from Academia Sinica, founded in 1928 by the Guomindang Nationalist Government. After the Communist Party took control of mainland China, Academia Sinica was renamed Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has six academic divisions:
Mathematics and Physics ()
Chemistry ()
Life Sciences and Medical Sciences ()
Earth Sciences ()
Information Technological Sciences ()
Technological Sciences ()
The CAS has thirteen regional branches in Beijing, Shenyang, Changchun, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Hefei and Xinjiang. It has over one hundred institutes and two universities (the University of Science and Technology of China at Hefei, Anhui and the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing). Backed by the institutes of CAS, UCAS is headquartered in Beijing, with graduate education bases in Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Lanzhou, four Science Libraries of Chinese Academy of Sciences, three technology support centers and two news and publishing units. These CAS branches and offices are located in 20 provinces and municipalities throughout China. CAS has invested in or created over 430 science- and technology-based enterprises in eleven industries including eight companies listed on stock exchanges.
Being granted a Fellowship of the Academy represents the highest level of national honor for Chinese scientists. The CAS membership system includes Academicians (), Emeritus Academician () and Foreign Academicians ().

== Scientific integrity ==
On 26 February 2007, the CAS published a Declaration of Scientific Ideology and set up a commission for scientific integrity to promote transparency, autonomy and accountability of scientific research in the country. The Ministry of Science and Technology had at the same time also initiated measures to address misconduct in state-funded programs.


== Publications ==
Together with the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the academy publishes the peer-reviewed academic journal, Science China (also known as Science in China). Science China comprises seven series:
A: Mathematics
B: Chemistry
C: Life Sciences
D: Earth Sciences
E: Technological Sciences
F: Information Sciences
G: Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy


== Awards ==
Since 1999 the CAS has issued the annual State Preeminent Science and Technology Award, presented by the President of China to the recipient.
