The Queen Mary Falls is a plunge waterfall on the Spring Creek that is located in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia.


== Location and features ==
The falls are situated in the Main Range National Park and descend 40 metres (130 ft) from the McPherson Range near the Queensland/New South Wales border. They are located 50 kilometres (31 mi) south-east of Warwick and 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) east of the town of Killarney.
The falls formed when water erosion by streams created gorges through layers of basalt and resistant trachyte. The falls are currently retreating as large blocks at the bottom of the falls were not evident in photos taken in the 19th century. Facilities at the falls include toilets, tables and fireplaces.
Four other waterfalls are located in the area surrounding Killarney, including the Teviot Falls, Daggs Falls, Browns Falls and Upper Browns Falls.
