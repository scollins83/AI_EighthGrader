The Hohengeroldseck family or House of Geroldseck was a German noble family which arrived in Baden-Baden about 948 and ended on the male line in 1636 with the death of Kurfrsten Jacob von und zu Geroldseck. They were heavily involved in mining of ores, especially silver. The Hohengeroldseck family founded many monasteries within the Zhringen order. Their family seat is Castle Hohengeroldseck in Biberach.
The last Hohengeroldseck was Kurfrsten Jacob von und zu Hohengeroldseck, who died in 1636. With only a daughter, Princess Elizabeth von und zu Hohengeroldseck, the titles and lands of Hohengeroldseck were transferred to her husband, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, and later became part of the Duchy of Bavaria.
In 1806 the County of Hohengeroldseck was purchased from the Austrian Empire by the Principality von der Leyen, which became a member of the Rhine Confederation as a puppet state of France, and later joined the German Confederation in 1815. Its capital was Seelbach. In 1819 Hohengeroldseck und von der Leyen was absorbed into the Grand Duchy of Baden.
