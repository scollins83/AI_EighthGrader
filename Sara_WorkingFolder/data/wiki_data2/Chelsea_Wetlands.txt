Chelsea Wetlands is a 12 acre (4.9 hectare) marshland of the San Francisco Bay in Hercules, California.


== History ==
Originally part of a much larger system of wetlands lining the shoreline of western Contra Costa County, Chelsea is the remainder of the undeveloped coastal marshes of Hercules. Once home to egrets the marsh has been degraded by dumping of soil from surrounding construction projects. The site however remains crucial habitat to wildlife including endangered species such as the California clapper rail and salt marsh common yellowthroat. The marsh's host city is searching for funds to restore the creek and the flood plain surrounding it to protect against flooding to the adjacent neighborhood and to restore habitat for the living organisms that call the wetlands home.
