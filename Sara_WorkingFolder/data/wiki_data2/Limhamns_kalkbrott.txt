Limhamns kalkbrott (Limhamn limestone quarry) or Kalkbrottet (the limestone quarry) is situated near Malm, in the Borough of Limhamn-Bunkeflo, Malm Municipality, Skne County, Sweden.
The quarry was opened in 1866, and it is one of the largest open-pit mines in Northern Europe, measuring 1300 by 800 meters, with a depth of 65 meters. A railway line connects the quarry to the cement factory in Limhamn port, with about two kilometers of the railway connection going in a tunnel (opened in 1968) to reduce air pollution. Mining of limestone in the quarry ceased in 1994.
