Kwai Chung Incineration Plant (Chinese: ) was one of four incineration plants in Hong Kong. The plant was built on a 1.4 hectares (3.5 acres) of reclaimed land along Gin Drinkers Bay, Kwai Chung, near Tsing Chau and the Rambler Channel.
The plant was opened in 1978 to process solid waste from Hong Kong to reduce the need to put waste into landfills.


== Cessation of operation ==
In 1989, the Hong Kong Government issued a white paper, Pollution in Hong Kong - A Time to Act. After considering the effects of air pollution on the environment and public health, it was decided to cease using incineration to dispose of solid waste. This decision was later suspended and, as of 2008, the Hong Kong Government is considering constructing new incinerators.
In May 1997, the Kwai Chung Incineration Plant ceased to operate, the last of Hong Kong's four plants to do so:
Lai Chi Kok Incineration Plant - commissioned 1969 and decommissioned 1991; now part of the expanded container port area
Kennedy Town Incineration Plant - commissioned 1967 and located next to Island West Transfer Station; decommissioned 1993 and now berthing facility
Mui Wo Incineration Plant - commissioned 1987 and decommissioned 1994; now site of Silvermine Bay Outdoor Recreation Camp


== Demolition ==
Although the plant ceased operation in 1997, it was not completely demolished . The site was found to be contaminated with dioxin, furan, asbestos, heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons. Special procedures were required during demolition.
Demolition of the building and 150-metre-high (490 ft) chimney was initiated in 2007.
The site cleanup preceded the demolition to clean up potential toxins and for future development of the site.
