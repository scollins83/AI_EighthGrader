Professor Alfred Krner (8 September 1939 in Kassel, Germany ) is a retired Professor of Geology at Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in Mainz, Germany. He specializes in the pre-Cambrian geology of Africa.
The American Journal of Science, published by Yale University, in dedicating a special issue to him on his 60th birthday,  said that it was

celebrated with a symposium in Mainz. It was here at the Johannes Gutenberg-University that Alfred was appointed full Professor of Geology in 1977.
