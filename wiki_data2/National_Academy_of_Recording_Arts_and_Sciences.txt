The Recording Academy, also known as The National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS), is a U.S. organization of musicians, producers, recording engineers and other recording professionals dedicated to improving the quality of life and cultural condition for music and its makers. The Recording Academy is headquartered in Santa Monica. Neil Portnow is the current president of The Academy.
The Recording Academy, which began in 1957, is known for its Grammy Awards. In 1997, the Recording Academy launched The Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, Inc., which produces the Latin GRAMMY Awards. Michael Greene was the founder and the first President of the Latin Grammys.


== HistoryEdit ==
The origin of the Academy dates back to the beginning of the 1950s Hollywood Walk of Fame project. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce asked the help of major recording industry executives in compiling a list of people in the music business who should be honored by Walk of Fame stars. The music committee, made up of these executives, compiled a list, but as they worked, they realized there were many more talented industry people who would not qualify to be recognized with a Hollywood Boulevard bronze star. The founding committee members included Jesse Kaye, MGM Records; Lloyd Dunn and Richard Jones, Capitol Records; Sonny Burke and Milt Gabler, Decca Records; Dennis Farnon, RCA Records; and Axel Stordahl, Paul Weston, and Doris Day from Columbia Records. This was the start of the Academy and also of the GRAMMY Awards.


== Producers & Engineers WingEdit ==
The Producers and Engineers Wing (P&E Wing) is a part of the academy made up of producers, engineers, mixers, and other technically involved professionals. It is composed of almost 6,000 members. The producers and Engineers wing addresses various aspects of issues facing the recording profession. They also support music and recording arts education. The P&E Wing also advocates for the use of professional usage of recording technology as well as the preservation of recordings.
The members of this division make up a large portion of those who vote on the Grammy Awards each year.


== GRAMMY University Network (GRAMMY U)Edit ==
The GRAMMY University Network (GRAMMY U) is an organization for college students who are pursuing a career in the music industry.
The Recording Academy created the Grammy University network to help students prepare a career in the music industry so they can get themselves established as a professional in the field. This is done through forms of networking, interactive educational experiences and programs as well as internship opportunities.
GRAMMY U is designed to enhance students' current academic curriculum with access to recording industry professionals to give them perspectives on the recording industry.


== MusiCaresEdit ==
The Recording Academy supports the MusiCares Foundation [1], a philanthropic organization whose mission is to "provide a safety net of critical assistance for musicians in times of need. MusiCares' services and resources cover a wide range of financial, medical and personal emergencies, and each case is treated with integrity and confidentiality. MusiCares also focuses the resources and attention of the music industry on human service issues that directly impact the health and welfare of the music community."
On February 14, 2011, MusiCares began their first public outreach and donation campaign. With the goal of raising 1 million dollars in funding by November 25, 2011, MusiCares launched "Be a Part of the Heart"[2], as a donation site and campaign to foster awareness to the public.
Michael Greene was the Founder and first President of the Musicares Foundation. In its first 20 years MusiCares served 65,000 clients, awarded 18,000 grants, and provided $24 million in funding. MusiCares has never turned away a request from a qualified applicant and all its services are completely confidential. MusiCares provides an average of $2 million annually in direct financial assistance to approximately 1,000 clients. MusiCares presents health fairs, clinics and workshops to music community members in order to illuminate the pathway to wellness. 76% of all MusiCares clients have no health insurance.
