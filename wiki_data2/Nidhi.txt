In the context of Hindu mythology, Nidhi, that is, a treasure, constituted of nine treasures (nawanidhi) belonging to Kubera (also spelt as Kuvera), the god of wealth. According to the tradition, each nidhi is personified as having a guardian spirit, and some tantrikas worship them. The nature and characteristics of nidhis have remained largely unexplained and have not been fully understood. According to Amarakosha, the nine nidhis are:
mahapadma "great lotus flower"
padma "lotus flower"
shankha "conch"
makara "crocodile"
kachchhapa "tortoise"
kumud "a particular precious stone"
kunda "jasmine"
nila "sapphire"
kharva "dwarf"
When considered as mines, minerals, earthenware and ocean resources, the nine treasures of Kubera are interpreted as:
mahapadma (lake double the size of padma in Himalaya with minerals and jewels)
padma (lake in Himalaya with minerals and jewels)
shankha (conch shell)
makara (synonym of Padmini, black antimony)
kachchhapa (tortoise or turtle shell)
kumud (cinnabar, or quicksilver)
kunda (arsenic)
nila (antimony)
kharva (cups or vessels baked in fire)
Nidhis are also called Nidhana, Nikhara, and Sevadhi. Some of the nidhis' names are used in the Indian numbering system..
