The Mineral Fork Formation is a mapped Proterozoic bedrock unit in Utah.


== Description ==
Granger et al. (1952) describe the Mineral Fork Formation as black tillite consisting of boulders, cobbles and pebbles of quartzite, limestone, or granitic rocks in a black sandy matrix, with dark-gray to black varved slate or shale, dark-gray quartzite, and occasional channel fillings of boulder conglomerate.


=== Exposures ===
According to Yonkee et al. (2000), the Mineral Fork is exposed at the following locations in Utah:
Antelope Island
Big Cottonwood Canyon
Santaquin-Provo
And also:
Little Cottonwood Canyon


=== Fossils ===
Abundant microfossils of planktonic alga of Bavlinella faveolata.


== Age ==
The presence of Bavlinella faveolata in the formation indicates a likely age of 750650 Ma, because this fossil occurs elsewhere where it is well-dated radiometrically. The Mineral Fork Formation is no older than 1,250 Ma and no younger than 540 Ma. Thus it is likely Neoproterozoic but possibly Mesoproterozoic.
