At the end of 2014, the installed capacity for wind power in Washington was 3,075 megawatts (MW) with wind power accounting for 6% of the electricity generated in the state during 2014. The state ranks among the top ten in terms of cumulative wind capacity.


== State legislative support ==

Initiative 937 requires electric utilities with 25,000 or more customers to have 15 percent of their power supply generated from renewable resources by 2020. Washington state has sales tax exemptions for wind energy. Washington state provides utility grants, loans and rebates for wind power.

== Potential capacity ==
While originally estimated to have nearly 4,000 megawatts of potential onshore capacity by the American Wind Energy Association, a comprehensive update of the wind energy potential by state released in 2010 by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showed that Washington has potential to install over 18,000 megawatts of onshore wind power.
Washington ranks 24th in its potential for onshore wind generation, but has the potential to install 120,964 MW of offshore wind farms, capable of generating 488,025 GWh/year.


=== Installed ===
Installed wind power capacity in Washington has seen strong growth in recent years and Washington now ranks among the top ten states with the most wind power installed. Wind power accounted for 5.3% of total electricity generated in Washington during 2011.
The table below shows the growth in wind power installed nameplate capacity in MW for Washington since 1999.
