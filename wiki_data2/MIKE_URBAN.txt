MIKE URBAN is a GIS-based urban modeling system for water distribution systems and wastewater collection systems. MIKE URBAN developed by DHI Water.Environment.Health and it is fully integrated with ArcGISTM (ESRI).


== Modules ==
MIKE URBAN includes three main modules: MIKE URBAN Model Manager, Collection System (CS) module, Water Distribution modules.
MIKE URBAN Model Manager: it is a time series data management package and a modeling environment, including two public domain modeling program, SWMM5 and EPANET, that were developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Collection System (CS) module: it includes pipe flow simulation, rainfall-runoff simulation, real-time control simulation, pollutant transport simulation, biological processes simulation.
Water Distribution (WD) module: it includes automatic calibration of water distribution network models, fire-flow tool for analysing the capacity of water distribution systems, control simulation options for extended period simulations, transient flow simulation of fully pressurised systems.


== Applications ==
MIKE URBAN can be used for collection system (CS) and water distribution (WD) system data management, stormwater modeling, wastewater modeling and water distribution network modeling.
