== History ==
In 1985, the Physiology Department at New Zealand's University of Otago encouraged the development of a computer-based data acquisition system to replace their paper-based systems. In 1985, as part of his Computer Science Masters at the university, Michael Macknight built the MacLab, one of the first analog to digital converters that connected to a Macintosh computer.
Two software packages were then developed: Chart (chart-recorder software, now LabChart) and Scope (digital oscilloscope software), which provided software control of the recording unit as well as a range of display and analysis features:
In 1988, business name was registered and the company began manufacturing Macintosh computer-based data acquisition systems for the life sciences research market.
In 1996 the company's first Windows compatible data acquisition system was released. The Windows compatible MacLab data acquisition systems were branded as PowerLab.
In 2005 the LabTutor software for education was released.
