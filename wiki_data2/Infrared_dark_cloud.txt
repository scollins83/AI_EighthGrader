An infrared dark cloud (IRDC) is a cold, dense region of a giant molecular cloud. They can be seen in silhouette against the bright diffuse mid-infrared emission from the galactic plane.


== Discovery ==
Infrared dark clouds have only been recently discovered in 1996 using the ISO  and therefore are in need of further research.


== Importance ==
Astronomers believe that they represent the earliest stage in the formation of high-mass stars  and are therefore of great importance for understanding the star formation process as a whole.
