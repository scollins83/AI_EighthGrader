The Saturn Award is an award presented annually by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films to honor the top works mainly in science fiction, fantasy, and horror in film, television, and home video. The award was initially, and is still sometimes, loosely referred to as a Golden Scroll.


== HistoryEdit ==
The Saturn Awards were devised by Dr. Donald A. Reed in 1972, who felt that films within the genres of science fiction and fantasy were never given the appreciation they deserved at that time. The physical award is a representation of the planet Saturn, with its ring(s) composed of film.
The Saturn Awards are voted on by members of the presenting Academy. The academy is a non-profit organization with membership open to the public. Its members include filmmakers Jeff Rector, Rich Correll, Tom De Santo, Mark A. Altman and Irwin Keyes, among others.
Although the awards still primarily nominate films and TV in the science fiction, fantasy and horror categories, the Saturns have also recognized productions in standard dramatic genres. There are also special awards for lifetime achievement in the field. The 40th Saturn Awards were held on June 26, 2014, in Burbank, California.


== CriticismEdit ==
