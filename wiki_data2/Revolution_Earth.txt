== Song information ==
The song is an upbeat, folk influenced song, a radical stylistic departure for the B-52's. Featuring Kate Pierson on lead vocals, "Revolution Earth" remains a fan favourite despite the fact that it is from an album featuring only three of the original five members of the band. With founding member Cindy Wilson absent from the recording, Pierson sings in harmony with herself - multi-tracking different vocal lines. Fred Schneider sings a brief backing vocal. As with many of the tracks from the Good Stuff album, "Revolution Earth" has a long and resounding intro and outro, as opposed to the band's earlier songs which always had a definite beginning and ending.
"Revolution Earth" was regularly featured in the B-52's live shows from 1992 up until about 2001. When Cindy Wilson rejoined the band in 1994, she sang backing vocals when the song was performed live. Latter live performances were couched in a faster rhythm and featured Sara Lee (then bass player for the band) on backing vocals, along with Wilson.
"Revolution Earth" is one of many songs with lyrics co-written with Robert Waldrop, a friend of the band.
