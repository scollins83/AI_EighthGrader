UX Arietis is a variable star of the RS CVn type, located in the northern zodiacal constellation of Aries. Based upon parallax measurements from the Hipparcos satellite, it is roughly 168 light years away. The variability of the star is believed due to a combination of cool star spots and warm flares, set against the baseline quiescent temperature of the stellar atmosphere. The variability appears to be cyclical with a period of 89 years.
