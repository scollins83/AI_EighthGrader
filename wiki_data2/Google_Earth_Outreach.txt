Google Earth Outreach is Google's program for donating and supporting non-profit organizations spreading the knowledge of global awareness since 2007. Google Earth Outreach offers online training on using Google Earth and Google Maps for public education on issues affecting local regions or the entire globe.
In June 2008 a training was given to 20 indigenous tribes in the Amazon rainforest, such as the Suru, to help them preserve their culture and protect their rainforest territory from deforestation.
People who create content for the public benefit sector can submit their KML to the Showcase Gallery, where content on Global Development, Public Health, Environment and Science, Culture and Education, and Social Services is posted. The program has been launched in 9 countries: US, UK, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and Brazil. This program also has a folder in Google Earth featuring layers from the programs it supports. Eligible charitable organizations can apply for a grant of the Google Earth Pro software, Google SketchUp Pro software, and Google Maps API Premier grants.
Google Earth Outreach features videos in a YouTube Channel.
