On the NBC morning news program Today, the designation "special edition" often applies to instances wherein one or both hosts anchor the program from a location other than Studio 1-A, or in the event of significant news developments. The expansion of an episode is not at all unusual, usually for planned long-duration news events such as presidential inaugurations or elections. The first such expanded edition came on January 20, 1953, with the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Breaking news can also extend the show's hours: during the July 7, 2005 London bombings and Friday following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, Today remained on the air for six hours, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT.
Most special editions are introduced as "From NBC News, this is a special edition of Today".
These were just some of the special editions of Today that were broadcast.
