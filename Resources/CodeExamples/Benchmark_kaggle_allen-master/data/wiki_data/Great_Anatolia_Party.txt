the great anatolia party (turkish: byk anadolu partisi abbreviated as bap and formerly abbreviated as banap) was a political party in turkey
== disputes with the motherland party ==
the great anatolia party was founded in 1986 as an opposition group to the dominant motherland party of prime minister turgut zal; the founders of the great anatolia party were supporters of the right path party
disputes arose quickly between the great anatolia party and the motherland party first about the abbreviation initially the name "great anatolia party" (byk anadolu partisi) was "bap" but the party changed it to "banap" the cause for thenew abbreviation was political: "banap" was similar to "anap" the abbreviation of the motherland party (anavatan partisi)
a second dispute concerned the logo of the great anatolia party because the main elements of the logo were the map of turkey and the honey bee just like the motherland party's logo
the motherland party protested against these cases and litigated to the constitutional court and the supreme electoral council the constitutional court didn't intervene but the supreme electoral council warned the great anatolia party about the abbreviation and logo issues after that the great anatolia party changed its abbreviation from "banap" back to "bap" and created a new logo
the new logo consisted from a perforated drum and a jaguar leaping through the hole in the drum these images referred to drummer asm ekren who was the son-in-law of the anap leader turgut zal while the jaguar was a reference to his jaguar car a gift from businessman zeki berberolu the new logo caused the party to acquire a new nickname "the party of drum driller jaguar" (turkish: davulu delen jaguar partisi)
