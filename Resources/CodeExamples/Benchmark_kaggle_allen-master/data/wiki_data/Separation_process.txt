in chemistry and chemical engineering a separation process or a separation technique or simply a separation is a method to achieve any mass transfer phenomenon that converts a mixture of substances into two or more distinct product mixtures (which may be referred to as fractions) at least one of which is enriched in one or more of the mixture's constituents in some cases a separation may fully divide the mixture into its pure constituents separations are carried out based on differences in chemical properties or physical properties such as size shape mass density or chemical affinity between the constituents of a mixture they are often classified according to the particular differences they use to achieve separation usually there is only physical movement and no substantial chemical modification if no single difference can be used to accomplish a desired separation multiple operations will often be performed in combination to achieve the desired end
with a few exceptions elements or compounds are naturally found in an impure state often these impure raw materials must be separated into their purified components before they can be put to productive use making separation techniques essential for the modern industrial economy in some cases these separations require total purification as in the electrolysis refining of bauxite ore for aluminum metal but a good example of an incomplete separation technique is oil refining crude oil occurs naturally as a mixture of various hydrocarbons and impurities the refining process splits this mixture into other more valuable mixtures such as natural gas gasoline and chemical feedstocks none of which are pure substances but each of which must be separated from the raw crude in both of these cases a series of separations is necessary to obtain the desired end products in the case of oil refining crude is subjected to a long series of individual distillation steps each of which produces a different product or intermediate
the purpose of a separation may be analytical i.e to help analyze components in the original mixture without any attempt to save the fractions or may be preparative i.e to "prepare" fractions or samples of the components that can be saved the separation can be done on a small scale effectively a laboratory scale for analytical or preparative purposes or on a large scale effectively an industrial scale for preparative purposes or on some intermediate scale

in paper chromatography the movement of each substance in the mixture depends on two factors: solubility of the substance in the solvent and adsorption of the substance on the filter paper the substance moves with the solvent easily if the substance is very soluble in the solvent and some solids can attract other substances and hold them on their surface this is called adsorption and such solids are called adsorbents the substance does not move with the solvent easily if the substance in the mixture is strongly absorbed by the filter paper since neither substance has the same adsorption and solubility each travels a different distance along the filter paperand the two separate
substances separated by chromatography need not be colored colorless substances can be made visible by spraying the paper with a locating agent that reacts with the colorless substances to produce a color labs use chromatography to identify the substances in a mixture hospital labs for example use the technique to determine if a patient has diabetes by identifying sugar in urine chromatography also identifies dyes used in food

dissolved air flotation removes suspended solids non-selectively from slurry by bubbles that are generated by air coming out of solution
froth flotation recovers valuable hydrophobic solids by attachment to air bubbles generated by mechanical agitation of an air-slurry mixture which float and are recovered
deinking separating hydrophobic ink particles from hydrophilic paper pulp in paper recycling
flocculation separates a solid from a liquid in a colloid by use of a flocculant which promotes the solid clumping into flocs
filtration mesh bag and paper filters are used to remove large particulates suspended in fluids (e.g. fly ash) while membrane processes including microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis dialysis (biochemistry) utilising synthetic membranes separates micrometre-sized or smaller species
