chemical decomposition analysis or breakdown is the separation of a chemical compound into elements or simpler compounds it is sometimes defined as the exact opposite of a chemical synthesis chemical decomposition is often an undesired chemical reaction the stability that a chemical compound ordinarily has is eventually limited when exposed to extreme environmental conditions like heat radiation humidity or the acidity of a solvent the details of decomposition processes are generally not well defined as a molecule may break up into a host of smaller fragments chemical decomposition is exploited in several analytical techniques notably mass spectrometry traditional gravimetric analysis and thermogravimetric analysis
a broader definition of the term decomposition also includes the breakdown of one phase into two or more phases
there are three broad types of decomposition reactions: thermal electrolytic and catalytic
== reaction formulaedit ==
the generalized reaction for chemical decomposition is:
ab a + b with a specific example being the electrolysis of water to gaseous hydrogen and oxygen:
2 h2o(i) 2 h2 + o2
=== additional examplesedit ===
an example of spontaneous decomposition is that of hydrogen peroxide which will slowly decompose into water and oxygen:
2 h2o2 2 h2o + o2
carbonates will decompose when heated a notable exception being that of carbonic acid h2co3 carbonic acid the "fizz" in sodas pop cans and other carbonated beverages will decompose over time (spontaneously) into carbon dioxide and water
h2co3 h2o + co2
other carbonates will decompose when heated producing the corresponding metal oxide and carbon dioxide in the following equation m represents a metal:
mco3 mo + co2
a specific example of this involving calcium carbonate:
caco3 cao + co2
metal chlorates also decompose when heated a metal chloride and oxygen gas are the products
2 mclo3 2 mcl + 3 o2
a common decomposition of a chlorate to evolve oxygen utilizes potassium chlorate as follows:
2 kclo3 2 kcl + 3 o2
