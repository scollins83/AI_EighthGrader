the atlantic blue marlin (makaira nigricans) is a species of marlin endemic to the atlantic ocean the atlantic blue marlin (hereafter blue marlin) feeds on a wide variety of organisms near the surface it uses its bill to stun injure or kill while knifing through a school of fish or other prey then returns to eat the injured or stunned fish marlin is a popular game fish the relatively high fat content of its meat makes it commercially valuable in certain markets it is the national fish of the commonwealth of the bahamas and is thus featured on its coat of arms
blue marlin are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the atlantic indian and pacific oceans a bluewater fish that spends the majority of its life in the open sea far from land the blue marlin preys on a wide variety of marine organisms mostly near the surface often using its bill to stun or injure its preys
females can grow up to four times the weight of males the maximum published weight is 818 kg (1,803 lb) and length 5 m (16.4 ft)
adult blue marlin have few predators apart from man they are sought after as a highly prized game fish by anglers and are taken by commercial fishermen both as a directed catch and as bycatch in major industrial tuna fisheries blue marlin are currently considered a threatened species by the iucn due to overfishing
some other historic english names for the blue marlin are cuban black marlin ocean gar and ocean guard
== taxonomy and naming ==
the blue marlin is placed in the genus makaira this name is derived from the greek word machaira meaning "a short sword or bent dagger" and the latin machaera "sword" the specific epithet nigricans is latin for "becoming black" the blue marlin is part of the billfish family istiophoridae and is in the perch-like order perciformes in addition it is in the suborder xiphioidei and is a member of the subclass neopterygii which means "new wings" it is also in the class of actinopterygii which includes ray-finned fishes and spiny-rayed fishes and the superclass osteichthyes which includes all of the bony fishes
the classification of the atlantic blue marlin (makaira nigricans) and the indo-pacific blue marlin (makaira mazara) as separate species is under debate genetic data suggest although the two groups are isolated from each other they are both the same species with the only genetic exchange occurring when indo-pacific blue marlin migrate to and contribute genes to the atlantic population a separate study by v p buonaccorsi j r mcdowell and graves indicated that both indo-pacific and atlantic show "striking phylogeographic partitioning" of mitochondrial and microsatellite loci

== description ==
the biggest females are more than four times as heavy as the biggest males which rarely exceed 160 kg (350 lb) in weight the longest females can reach a length of 5 m (16 ft) with the bill from eye to tip constituting about 20% of the total body length
body mass in the largest female specimens has been reported from 540 to 820 kg (1,190 to 1,810 lb) depending on the source (few large specimens are scientifically verified) the largest blue marlin caught by igfa angling rules is from vitoria brazil which weighed 1,402 lb (636 kg).; fishermen often refer to individual marlins that reach or exceed 1,000 pounds as "granders"
both sexes have 24 vertebrae of which 11 are precaudal and 13 are caudal
the marlin has two dorsal fins and two anal fins the fins are supported by bony spines known as rays its first dorsal fin has 39 to 43 rays from front to back its second dorsal fin has six or seven rays its first anal fin which is similar in shape and size to the second dorsal fin has 13 to 16 rays and the second anal fin has six or seven rays the pectoral fins which have 19 to 22 rays are long and narrow and can be drawn in to the sides of the body the pelvic fins are shorter than the pectorals have a poorly developed membrane and are depressible into ventral grooves its first anal fin along with its pectoral and caudal fins can be folded into grooves this streamlines the fish and thereby reduces drag
blue marlin like other billfish can rapidly change color an effect created by pigment-containing iridophores and light-reflecting skin cells
most often however the body is blue-black on top with a silvery white underside it has about 15 rows of pale cobalt-colored stripes each of which has round dots and/or thin bars located on both sides of the fish the first dorsal fin membrane is dark blue or almost black and has no dots or marks other fins are normally brownish-black sometimes with a hint of dark blue the bases of the first and second anal fins have a hint of silvery white
the body is covered with thick bony elongated scales that have one two or three posterior points with one being the most common form
the bill is long and stout both the jaws and the palatines (the roof of the mouth) are covered with small file-like teeth the lateral line system is a group of neuromasts rooted in lateral line canals that can sense weak water motions and large changes in pressure it has the appearance of a net it is obvious in immature specimens but unclear in adults becoming progressively embedded in the skin the anus is just in front of the origin of the first anal fin
== range and migration ==
blue marlin are found year-round in tropical oceanic waters of the atlantic and indo-pacific the range expands into temperate waters of the northern and southern hemispheres during the warmer months and contracts towards the equator during colder months warm currents such as the gulf stream in the western atlantic and the agulhas current in the western indian ocean have a major influence on their seasonal distribution
in the atlantic the blue marlin's latitudinal range extends from about 45n to about 35s it is less abundant in the eastern atlantic where it mostly occurs off africa between the latitudes of 25n and 25s the largest numbers are usually found in waters warmer than 24 c (75 f) but blue marlin have been found at surface water temperatures as high as 30.5 c (86.9 f) and as low as 21.7 c (71.1 f)
tagging studies using conventional "spaghetti" tags and more recently pop-up satellite tags have given researchers a glimpse into blue marlin migration patterns and habits recaptures of tagged fish have shown multiple movements between the caribbean islands and venezuela and the bahamas as well as between the caribbean saint thomas u.s virgin islands and west africa as well interocean travel most notably a blue marlin tagged off the coast of delaware was recovered near the island of mauritius off the southeast coast of africa in the indian ocean a voyage of 9,254 miles blue marlin tagged in the pacific have also been recovered in the indian ocean several fish have been recaptured in the same general area where they were tagged implying reverse migration after/over several years but the data are insufficient to accurately determine seasonality
== predators and parasites ==
once blue marlin reach maturity they have few predators with the most important probably being large pelagic sharks such as the shortfin mako and great white shark
blue marlin have many parasites they include parasites from these groups: digenea (flukes) didymozoidea (tissue flukes) monogenea (gillworms) cestoda (tapeworms) nematoda (roundworms) acanthocephala (spiny-headed worms) copepods barnacles and cookiecutter sharks
remoras are commonly found attached to blue marlin often inside the opercula
== lifecycle ==
growth and maturity
atlantic blue marlin reach sexual maturity at the age of two to four years males reach sexual maturity at a weight of 3544 kg (7797 lb) and females at 4761 kg (104134 lb) blue marlin breed in late summer and fall females may spawn as many as four times in one season they often release over seven million eggs at once each about 1 mm (0.039 in) in diameter few reach sexual maturity the planktonic young drift freely in the ocean's pelagic zone larvae inhabit the west central atlantic off georgia north carolina florida jamaica bahamas the dominican republic and puerto rico and also the southwest atlantic off brazil the larvae may grow as much as 16 mm (0.63 in) in a day on their sides and dorsal surfaces they are blue-black in color while ventrally they are white both the caudal fin and the caudal peduncle (the narrow part of the fish's body to which the caudal or tail fin is attached) are clear two iridescent blue patches occur on the head and some individuals have darker spots on their backs in adolescents the first dorsal fin is large and concave gradually reducing in proportion to body size with continued growth males may live for 18 years and females up to 27
diet and feeding
the larvae feed upon a variety of zooplankton along with drifting fish eggs and other larvae they progress to feeding on a wide range of fishes particularly scombrids such as mackerel and tuna squid and especially near oceanic islands and coral reefs on juvenile inshore fish studies of stomach contents in both the atlantic and pacific have found that smaller schooling scombrids such as frigate mackerel bullet tuna and skipjack tuna make up a substantial proportion of their diet squid and deep-sea fishes such as pomfret and snake mackerel are also important prey items in certain areas blue marlin have been recorded to take prey as large as white marlin as well as yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the 100-lb range conversely they are also capable of feeding on small but numerous prey such as filefish and snipefish
scientists and fishermen have long debated the extent to which blue marlin and other billfish use their elongated upper jaw in feeding a 2007 japanese study of stomach contents of fish captured in a commercial trolling fishery found that 130 undigested prey items obtained from 227 blue marlin had spearing slashing and other injuries that were judged to have been inflicted by the bill
== economic importance ==
=== commercial fishery ===
marlin has commercial value throughout the world with landings totalling 3,064 metric tons in 2000 it is particularly valued in japan for sashimi in hawaii where the fish is known as a'u blue marlin meat is sometimes smoked and sold by roadside vendors
blue marlin are often caught as bycatch in tuna longline fisheries
=== recreational fishery ===
sport fishermen first encountered blue marlin in the bahamas in the 1920s and early 1930s when pioneering big-game fishermen such as van campen heilner and kip farrington began exploring the waters offshore of bimini and cat cay in the pacific blue marlin (then known as silver marlin or often misidentified as the related black marlin) were caught by author/angler zane grey in tahiti in the 1930s since then blue marlin have been renowned as one of the world's greatest game fishes the sportfishing pursuit of marlin and other billfish has developed into a multimillion dollar industry that includes hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs for boat operators boat builders marinas dealerships and fishing tackle manufacturers and dealers
the most established sport fisheries for blue marlin are found along the eastern seaboard and the gulf coast of the united states bermuda the bahamas and several other caribbean islands (notably st thomas and puerto rico) recreational fishing for blue marlin also takes place in brazil venezuela and the atlantic coast of mexico particularly the yucatan peninsula in the eastern atlantic blue marlin sport fisheries exist from the algarve coast of portugal in the north to angola in the south and include the islands of the azores canaries cape verde madeira and ascension island
the international game fish association all-tackle world record for blue marlin currently stands at 1,402 lb 2 oz (636 kg) this fish was captured in vitoria brazil
== conservation ==
the blue marlin is under intense pressure from longline fishing in the caribbean region alone japanese and cuban fishermen annually take over a thousand tons all vessels within 200 mi (320 km) of the u.s coastline are required to release any billfish caught however the survival rate of released fish is low because of damage during capture
makaira nigricans is listed as a threatened species by the international union for conservation of nature in 2010 greenpeace international added the blue marlin to its seafood red list
sport fishermen have been at the forefront of efforts to conserve blue marlin populations the initial efforts to develop electronic tags for tracking highly migratory fish were carried out on marlin in hawaii in collaboration with anglers in the hawaiian international billfish tournament
== in popular culture ==
both zane grey and ernest hemingway who fished for blue marlin off the florida keys the bahamas and most famously in cuba wrote extensively about their pursuit
in ernest hemingway's novella the old man and the sea a fisherman named santiago battles a blue marlin for three days off the coast of cuba
