dr arthur riggs (born 1939) ph.d is a geneticist who worked with genentech to express the first artificial gene in bacteria his work was critical to the modern biotechnology industry because it was the first use of molecular techniques in commercial production of drugs and enabled the large-scale manufacturing of protein drugs including insulin
riggs is a professor of biology and as of 2014 founding director of the diabetes & metabolism research institute of city of hope national medical center he was the founding dean of city of hope's graduate school the irell & manella graduate school of biological sciences he is also director emeritus of the beckman research institute of city of hope national medical center which he headed from 2000-2007 riggs serves on the board of trustees at the keck graduate institute of applied life sciences in 2006 riggs was elected to the national academy of sciences
== early life and education ==
arthur riggs was born in 1939 in a hospital in modesto california near his family's home in ceres california after the family lost their farm during the great depression they moved to san bernardino ca where riggs attended san bernardino high school he helped his father who managed a trailer park to build and fix things his mother a nurse gave him a chemistry set to encourage his interest in chemistry and biology
riggs earned his undergraduate degree in chemistry at university of california riverside in 1961 he conducted his doctoral thesis work at the california institute of technology with herschel k mitchell obtaining a ph.d in biochemistry in 1966
=== mammalian dna replication ===
as graduate students at caltech he and joel a huberman collaborated on work that later led to a classic paper on mammalian dna replication which was published in 1966 they wanted to use radioactive nucleotides to tag replicating dna and then use photographic film to create a physical image of what happens during replication their advisors were not interested in the experiment when huberman and riggs proposed it and the students continued the work on their own using their method they were able to measure the rate of dna replication the results indicated that chromosomal dna contained many sections which replicated independently and that replication occurred in both directions at each section's origin the results were important and helped to extend scientists' understanding of mammalian dna replication herschel mitchell and giuseppe attardi their advisors felt that the papers should be published under huberman and riggs' names without their advisors' because they had done the work independently
=== proteindna interaction ===
riggs went on to do postdoctoral work at the salk institute with melvin cohn from 1966 to 1969 studying proteindna interactions at the time two proteins had been identified as binding to dna and controlling gene expression: the lambda repressor and the lac repressor riggs worked on isolation of the lac repressor using affinity chromatography walter gilbert and benno mller-hill were the first to successfully identify it using a different technique however arthur riggs was the first to purify usable quantities of a transcription factor protein the lac repressor he and suzanne bourgeois developed a nitrocellulose filter binding assay method that was much faster than existing methods of analysis their work resulted in another well-known series of papers on the lac repressor and bacterial gene regulation opening up new areas of research and theory
== city of hope national medical center ==
as a result of his interest in gene regulation in mammalian cells riggs became curious about x chromosome inactivation in which one of the two copies of the x chromosome present in a female mammal is inactivated one of its co-discoverers susumu ohno worked at the city of hope national medical center in 1969 riggs joined the department of molecular biology at the city of hope national medical center as an associate research scientist he became a senior researcher in 1974 associate chair of the division of biology in 1979 and chair of the division of biology in 1981
=== somatostatin and insulin ===
initially riggs continued his lac repressor work examining gene regulation in bacteria with richard e dickerson john rosenberg and keiichi itakura they hoped to mix e coli lac repressor with lac operator crystallize it and examine the proteindna binding of the crystals using high-resolution dna methylation analysis they were able to clone itakura's lac operator and confirm that it would work in live bacteria an important result they also developed a method in which researchers add short "linkers" to dna sequences and insert them into bacteria
riggs and itakura collaborated with herbert boyer at genentech and used recombinant dna technology to become the first to produce a human protein in e coli following the advice of riggs and itakura the group successfully produced the hormone somatostatin in 1977 as a proof of concept before they attempted to work with the more complicated insulin molecule they were able to link somatostatin to a larger protein beta-galactosidase produce it in e coli isolate it and then separate the somatostatin from the galactosidase somatostatin was the first mammalian hormone to be produced in a bacteria
next the group created a gene coding for human insulin one that was about ten times times larger than the somatostatin encoding they succeeded in producing artificial insulin in 1978 in 1979 riggs received the juvenile diabetes foundation research award for this work
=== dna methylation epigenetics and antibody engineering ===
in 1973 riggs hypothesized that x chromosome inactivation might act in ways analogous to restriction enzyme complexes such as e coli he eventually published a theoretical paper on the topic that correctly predicted a key mechanism for dna methylation epigenetics through ongoing research he has helped to understand the mechanisms of dna methylation and gene regulation
in the 1980s riggs became convinced that the type of splicing approach used with recombinant dna also could be used to create antibodies riggs worked with shmuel cabilly on "fundamental technology required for the artificial synthesis of antibody molecules." once again riggs and his group characterized the genes for antibodies and cloned them into bacteria they were able to describe and patent a method for making humanized monoclonal antibodies using mouse antibodies they created a gene sequence that would "trick" bacteria into manufacturing humanized antibodies rather than mouse antibodies this technology has been used to create "smart" cancer drugs such as herceptin rituxan and avastin
in 2009 riggs published work done with gerd pfeifer on the "methylome" of the genome of a human b cell examining the dna methylation pattern of the entire genome in an attempt to find patterns of the epigenetic mark 5-methylcytosine dna methylation is believed to pass information from parent cells to daughter cells functioning as a secondary high-fidelity information encoding system the blood donated for isolation of the b cells was that of riggs himself "it could have been anyone's dna but as a pioneer in dna methylation epigenetics there is something special to me about it being my methylome" as of 2013 riggs continues to work on the epigenetic programming of the cell designing proteins that can bind to dna in highly specified ways wherever desired
=== administration ===
riggs has been closely involved in institutional expansion at city of hope in the 1990s riggs helped to created the city of hope graduate school of biological sciences (renamed the irell & manella graduate school of biological sciences as of may 15 2009) riggs served as its founding dean from 1994 to 1998
during rigg's time as chair of the division of biology (1981-2000) city of hope restructured in response to a $10 million grant from the arnold and mabel beckman foundation and established the beckman research institute of city of hope from its creation in 1983 riggs was chair of the division of biology of the beckman research institute from 2000-2007 riggs served as director of the beckman research institute
in 2014 city of hope opened a new diabetes & metabolism research institute building on its existing diabetes research program with arthur riggs as the institute's first director
