immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease is compromised or entirely absent immunodeficiency may also decrease cancer immunosurveillance most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired ("secondary") but some people are born with defects in their immune system or primary immunodeficiency transplant patients take medications to suppress their immune system as an anti-rejection measure as do some patients suffering from an over-active immune system a person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised an immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone
== typesedit ==
=== by affected componentedit ===
humoral immune deficiency with signs or symptoms depending on the cause but generally include signs of hypogammaglobulinemia (decrease of one or more types of antibodies) with presentations including repeated mild respiratory infections and/or agammaglobulinemia (lack of all or most antibody production) which results in frequent severe infections and is often fatal
t cell deficiency often causes secondary disorders such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome
granulocyte deficiency including decreased numbers of granulocytes (called as granulocytopenia or if absent agranulocytosis) such as of neutrophil granulocytes (termed neutropenia) granulocyte deficiencies also include decreased function of individual granulocytes such as in chronic granulomatous disease
asplenia where there is no function of the spleen
complement deficiency is where the function of the complement system is deficient
in reality immunodeficiency often affects multiple components with notable examples including severe combined immunodeficiency (which is primary) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (which is secondary)
=== primary or secondaryedit ===
distinction between primary versus secondary immunodeficiencies are based on respectively whether the cause originates in the immune system itself or is in turn due to insufficiency of a supporting component of it or an external decreasing factor of it
==== primary immunodeficiencyedit ====
a number of rare diseases feature a heightened susceptibility to infections from childhood onward primary immunodeficiency is also known as congenital immunodeficiencies many of these disorders are hereditary and are autosomal recessive or x-linked there are over 80 recognised primary immunodeficiency syndromes; they are generally grouped by the part of the immune system that is malfunctioning such as lymphocytes or granulocytes
the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies depends on the nature of the defect and may involve antibody infusions long-term antibiotics and (in some cases) stem cell transplantation
==== secondary immunodeficienciesedit ====
secondary immunodeficiencies also known as acquired immunodeficiencies can result from various immunosuppressive agents for example malnutrition aging and particular medications (e.g chemotherapy disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs immunosuppressive drugs after organ transplants glucocorticoids) for medications the term immunosuppression generally refers to both beneficial and potential adverse effects of decreasing the function of the immune system while the term immunodeficiency generally refers solely to the adverse effect of increased risk for infection
many specific diseases directly or indirectly cause immunosuppression this includes many types of cancer particularly those of the bone marrow and blood cells (leukemia lymphoma multiple myeloma) and certain chronic infections immunodeficiency is also the hallmark of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) hiv directly infects a small number of t helper cells and also impairs other immune system responses indirectly
== immunodeficiency and autoimmunityedit ==
there are a large number of immunodeficiency syndromes that present clinical and laboratory characteristics of autoimmunity the decreased ability of the immune system to clear infections in these patients may be responsible for causing autoimmunity through perpetual immune system activation
one example is common variable immunodeficiency (cvid) where multiple autoimmune diseases are seen e.g inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune thyroid disease familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency is another example pancytopenia rashes lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are commonly seen in these patients presence of multiple uncleared viral infections due to lack of perforin are thought to be responsible in addition to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis autoimmune hemolytic anemia scleroderma and type 1 diabetes are also seen in x-linked agammaglobulinemia (xla) recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammation of the gut and lungs are seen in chronic granulomatous disease (cgd) as well cgd is caused by a decreased production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase by neutrophils hypomorphic rag mutations are seen in patients with midline granulomatous disease; an autoimmune disorder that is commonly seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegenrs disease) and nk/t cell lymphomas wiskott-aldrich syndrome (was) patients also present with eczema autoimmune manifestations recurrent bacterial infections and lymphoma in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (apeced) also autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis finally iga deficiency is also sometimes associated with the development of autoimmune and atopic phenomena
