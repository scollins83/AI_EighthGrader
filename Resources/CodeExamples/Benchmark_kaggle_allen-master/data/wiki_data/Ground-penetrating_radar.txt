ground-penetrating radar (gpr) is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface this nondestructive method uses electromagnetic radiation in the microwave band (uhf/vhf frequencies) of the radio spectrum and detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures gpr can have applications in a variety of media including rock soil ice fresh water pavements and structures in the right conditions practitioners can use gpr to detect subsurface objects changes in material properties and voids and cracks
gpr uses high-frequency (usually polarized) radio waves usually in the range 10 mhz to 1 ghz a gpr transmitter emits electromagnetic energy into the ground when the energy encounters a buried object or a boundary between materials having different dielectric constants it may be reflected or refracted or scattered back to the surface a receiving antenna can then record the variations in the return signal the principles involved are similar to seismology except that electromagnetic energy is used instead of acoustic energy and energy may be reflected at boundaries where subsurface electrical properties change rather than subsurface mechanical properties as is the case with seismic energy
the electrical conductivity of the ground the transmitted center frequency and the radiated power all may limit the effective depth range of gpr investigation increases in electrical conductivity attenuate the introduced electromagnetic wave and thus the penetration depth decreases because of frequency-dependent attenuation mechanisms higher frequencies do not penetrate as far as lower frequencies however higher frequencies may provide improved resolution thus operating frequency is always a trade-off between resolution and penetration optimal depth of subsurface penetration is achieved in ice where the depth of penetration can achieve several thousand metres (to bedrock in greenland) at low gpr frequencies dry sandy soils or massive dry materials such as granite limestone and concrete tend to be resistive rather than conductive and the depth of penetration could be up to 15-metre (49 ft) in moist and/or clay-laden soils and materials with high electrical conductivity penetration may be as little as a few centimetres
ground-penetrating radar antennas are generally in contact with the ground for the strongest signal strength; however gpr air-launched antennas can be used above the ground
cross borehole gpr has developed within the field of hydrogeophysics to be a valuable means of assessing the presence and amount of soil water
== applications ==
gpr has many applications in a number of fields in the earth sciences it is used to study bedrock soils groundwater and ice it is of some utility in prospecting for gold nuggets and for diamonds in alluvial gravel beds by finding natural traps in buried stream beds that have the potential for accumulating heavier particles the chinese lunar rover yutu has a gpr on its underside to investigate the soil and crust of the moon
engineering applications include nondestructive testing (ndt) of structures and pavements locating buried structures and utility lines and studying soils and bedrock in environmental remediation gpr is used to define landfills contaminant plumes and other remediation sites while in archaeology it is used for mapping archaeological features and cemeteries gpr is used in law enforcement for locating clandestine graves and buried evidence military uses include detection of mines unexploded ordnance and tunnels
borehole radars utilizing gpr are used to map the structures from a borehole in underground mining applications modern directional borehole radar systems are able to produce three-dimensional images from measurements in a single borehole
one of the other main applications for ground-penetrating radars is for locating underground utilities standard electromagnetic induction utility locating tools require utilities to be conductive these tools are ineffective for locating plastic conduits or concrete storm and sanitary sewers since gpr detects variations in dielectric properties in the subsurface it can be highly effective for locating non-conductive utilities
gpr is often used on the channel 4 television programme time team which uses the technology to determine a suitable area for examination by means of excavations in 1992 gpr was used to recover 150,000 in cash that kidnapper michael sams received as a ransom for an estate agent he had kidnapped after sams buried the money in a field
=== archaeology ===
ground penetrating radar survey is one method used in archaeological geophysics gpr can be used to detect and map subsurface archaeological artifacts features and patterning
the concept of radar is familiar to most people with ground penetrating radar the radar signal an electromagnetic pulse is directed into the ground subsurface objects and stratigraphy (layering) will cause reflections that are picked up by a receiver the travel time of the reflected signal indicates the depth data may be plotted as profiles as planview maps isolating specific depths or as three-dimensional models
gpr can be a powerful tool in favorable conditions (uniform sandy soils are ideal) like other geophysical methods used in archaeology (and unlike excavation) it can locate artifacts and map features without any risk of damaging them among methods used in archaeological geophysics it is unique both in its ability to detect some small objects at relatively great depths and in its ability to distinguish the depth of anomaly sources
the principal disadvantage of gpr is that it is severely limited by less-than-ideal environmental conditions fine-grained sediments (clays and silts) are often problematic because their high electrical conductivity causes loss of signal strength; rocky or heterogeneous sediments scatter the gpr signal weakening the useful signal while increasing extraneous noise
=== military ===
military applications of ground-penetrating radar include detection of unexploded ordnance and detecting tunnels in military applications and other common gpr applications practitioners often use gpr in conjunction with other available geophysical techniques such as electrical resistivity and electromagnetic induction methods
== three-dimensional imaging ==
individual lines of gpr data represent a sectional (profile) view of the subsurface multiple lines of data systematically collected over an area may be used to construct three-dimensional or tomographic images data may be presented as three-dimensional blocks or as horizontal or vertical slices horizontal slices (known as "depth slices" or "time slices") are essentially planview maps isolating specific depths time-slicing has become standard practice in archaeological applications because horizontal patterning is often the most important indicator of cultural activities
== limitations ==
the most significant performance limitation of gpr is in high-conductivity materials such as clay soils and soils that are salt contaminated performance is also limited by signal scattering in heterogeneous conditions (e.g rocky soils)
other disadvantages of currently available gpr systems include:
interpretation of radargrams is generally non-intuitive to the novice
considerable expertise is necessary to effectively design conduct and interpret gpr surveys
relatively high energy consumption can be problematic for extensive field surveys
radar is sensitive to changes in material composition detecting changes requires movement when looking through stationary items using surface-penetrating or ground-penetrating radar the equipment needs to be moved in order for the radar to examine the specified area by looking for differences in material composition while it can identify items such as pipes voids and soil it cannot identify the specific materials such as gold and precious gems it can however be useful in providing subsurface mapping of potential gem-bearing pockets or "vugs." the readings can be confused by moisture in the ground and they can't separate gem-bearing pockets from the non-gem-bearing ones
when determining depth capabilities the frequency range of the antenna dictates the size of the antenna and the depth capability the grid spacing which is scanned is based on the size of the targets that need to be identified and the results required typical grid spacings can be 1 meter 3 ft 5 ft 10 ft 20 ft for ground surveys and 1in.-1 ft for walls and floors
the speed at which a radar signal travels is dependent upon the composition of the material being penetrated the depth to a target is determined based on the amount of time it takes for the radar signal to reflect back to the units antenna radar signals travel at different velocities through different types of materials it is possible to use the depth to a known object to determine a specific velocity and then calibrate the depth calculations
== power regulation ==
in 2005 the european telecommunications standards institute introduced legislation to regulate gpr equipment and gpr operators to control excess emissions of electromagnetic radiation the european gpr association (eurogpr) was formed as a trade association to represent and protect the legitimate use of gpr in europe
== similar technologies ==
ground-penetrating radar uses a variety of technologies to generate the radar signal: these are impulse stepped frequency frequency-modulated continuous-wave (fmcw) and noise systems on the market in 2009 also use digital signal processing (dsp) to process the data during survey work rather than off-line
a special kind of gpr uses unmodulated continuous-wave signals this holographic subsurface radar differs from other gpr types in that it records plan-view subsurface holograms depth penetration of this kind of radar is rather small (2030 cm) but lateral resolution is enough to discriminate different types of landmines in the soil or cavities defects bugging devices or other hidden objects in walls floors and structural elements
gpr is used on vehicles for close-in high-speed road survey and landmine detection as well as in stand-off mode
pipe-penetrating radar (ppr) is an application of gpr technologies applied in-pipe where the signals are directed through pipe and conduit walls to detect pipe wall thickness and voids behind the pipe walls
wall-penetrating radar can read through walls and even act as a motion sensor for police
the "mineseeker project" seeks to design a system to determine whether landmines are present in areas using ultra wideband synthetic aperture radar units mounted on blimps
