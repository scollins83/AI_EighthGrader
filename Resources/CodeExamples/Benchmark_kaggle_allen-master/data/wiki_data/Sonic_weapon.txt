sonic and ultrasonic weapons (usw) are weapons of various types that use sound to injure incapacitate or kill an opponent some sonic weapons are currently in limited use or in research and development by military and police forces others exist only in the realm of science fiction some of these weapons have been described as sonic bullets sonic grenades sonic mines or sonic cannons some make a focused beam of sound or ultrasound; some make an area field of sound
== usage and deployment ==
extremely high-power sound waves can disrupt or destroy the eardrums of a target and cause severe pain or disorientation this is usually sufficient to incapacitate a person less powerful sound waves can cause humans to experience nausea or discomfort the use of these frequencies to incapacitate persons has occurred both in counter-terrorist and crowd control settings
the possibility of a device that produces frequency that causes vibration of the eyeballs and therefore distortion of vision was apparently confirmed by the work of engineer vic tandy while attempting to demystify a haunting in his laboratory in coventry this spook was characterised by a feeling of unease and vague glimpses of a grey apparition some detective work implicated a newly installed extractor fan that tandy found was generating infrasound of 18.9 hz 0.3 hz and 9 hz
a long-range acoustic device has been used by the crew of the cruise ship seabourn spirit to deter pirates who chased and attacked the ship more commonly this device and others of similar design have been used to disperse protesters and rioters in crowd control efforts a similar system is called a "magnetic acoustic device" 'mobile' sonic devices have been used in grimsby hull and lancashire to deter teenagers from lingering around shops in target areas the device works by emitting an ultra-high frequency blast (around 1920 khz) that teenagers or people under approximately 20 are susceptible to and find uncomfortable age-related hearing loss apparently prevents the ultra-high pitch sound from causing a nuisance to those in their late twenties and above though this is wholly dependent on a young person's exposure to high sound pressure levels
high-amplitude sound of a specific pattern at a frequency close to the sensitivity peak of human hearing (23 khz) is used as a burglar deterrent
some police forces have used sound cannons against protesters for example during the g20 summit in pittsburgh
== research ==
studies have found that exposure to high intensity ultrasound at frequencies from 700 khz to 3.6 mhz can cause lung and intestinal damage in mice heart rate patterns following vibroacoustic stimulation has resulted in serious negative consequences such as atrial flutter and bradycardia
the extra-aural (unrelated to hearing) bioeffects on various internal organs and the central nervous system included auditory shifts vibrotactile sensitivity change muscle contraction cardiovascular function change central nervous system effects vestibular (inner ear) effects and chest wall/lung tissue effects researchers found that low frequency sonar exposure could result in significant cavitations hypothermia and tissue shearing no follow on experiments were recommended tests performed on mice show the threshold for both lung and liver damage occurs at about 184 db damage increases rapidly as intensity is increased the american institute of ultrasound in medicine (aium)has stated that there have been no proven biological effects associated with an unfocused sound beam with intensities below 100 mw/cm spta or focused sound beams below an intensity level of 1 mw/cm spta
noise-induced neurologic disturbances in scuba divers exposed to continuous low frequency tones for durations longer than 15 minutes has involved in some cases the development of immediate and long-term problems affecting brain tissue the symptoms resembled those of individuals who had suffered minor head injuries one theory for a causal mechanism is that the prolonged sound exposure resulted in enough mechanical strain to brain tissue to induce an encephalopathy divers and aquatic mammals may also suffer lung and sinus injuries from high intensity low frequency sound this is due to the ease with which low frequency sound passes from water into a body but not into any pockets of gas in the body which reflect the sound due to mismatched acoustic impedance

in the television series 'elementary' a sonic riot shield that vibrates at the same frequency of lung tissue is used in the episode "evidence of things not seen" to disrupt the breathing of the victims murdered at the beginning of the episode in order to allow the killer to get close to them before shooting them
