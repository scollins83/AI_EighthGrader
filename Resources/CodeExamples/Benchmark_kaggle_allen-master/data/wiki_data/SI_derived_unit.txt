the international system of units (si) specifies a set of seven base units from which all other si units of measurement are derived each of these other units (si derived units) is either dimensionless or can be expressed as a product of (positive or negative but usually integral) powers of one or more of the base units
for example the si derived unit of area is the square metre (m2) and the si derived unit of density is the kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m3 or kg m3) the degree celsius (see the table below) has a somewhat unclear status and is arguably an exception to this rule the names of si units are written in lowercase the symbols for units named after persons however are always written with an uppercase initial letter (e.g the symbol for the hertz is "hz"; but the symbol for the metre is "m")
== derived units with special namesedit ==
in addition to the two dimensionless derived units radian (rad) and steradian (sr) 20 other derived units have special names
== examples of derived quantities and unitsedit ==
== other units used with siedit ==
some other units such as the hour litre tonne and electron volt are not si units but are widely used in conjunction with si units
== supplementary unitsedit ==
until 1995 the si classified the radian and the steradian as supplementary units but this designation was abandoned and the units were grouped as derived units
