lihi seamount (also known as loihi) is an active submarine volcano located about 35 km (22 mi) off the southeast coast of the island of hawaii the top of the seamount is about 975 m (3,000 ft) below sea level this seamount lies on the flank of mauna loa the largest shield volcano on earth lihi meaning "long" in hawaiian is the newest volcano in the hawaiian-emperor seamount chain a string of volcanoes that stretches over 5,800 km (3,600 mi) northwest of lihi unlike most active volcanoes in the pacific ocean that make up the active plate margins on the pacific ring of fire lihi and the other volcanoes of the hawaiian-emperor seamount chain are hotspot volcanoes and formed well away from the nearest plate boundary volcanoes in the hawaiian islands arise from the hawaii hotspot and as the youngest volcano in the chain lihi is the only hawaiian volcano in the deep submarine preshield stage of development
lihi began forming around 400,000 years ago and is expected to begin emerging above sea level about 10,000100,000 years from now at its summit lihi seamount stands more than 3,000 m (10,000 ft) above the seafloor making it taller than mount st helens was before its catastrophic 1980 eruption the summit is currently 975 m (3,000 ft) below sea level a diverse microbial community resides around lihi's many hydrothermal vents
in the summer of 1996 a swarm of 4,070 earthquakes was recorded at lihi this series included more earthquakes than any other swarm in hawaiian recorded history the swarm altered 10 to 13 square kilometres (4 to 5 sq mi) of the seamount's summit; one section pele's vents collapsed entirely upon itself and formed the renamed pele's pit the volcano has remained relatively active since the 1996 swarm and is monitored by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) and the united states geological survey (usgs) the hawaii undersea geological observatory (hugo) provided real-time data on lihi between 1997 and 2002 lihi last erupted in 1996 before the earthquake swarm of that summer
== characteristics ==
=== geology ===
lihi is a seamount or underwater volcano on the flank of mauna loa the earth's largest shield volcano it is the newest volcano created by the hawaii hotspot in the extensive hawaiian-emperor seamount chain the distance between the summit of the older mauna loa and the summit of lihi is about 80 km (50 mi) which is coincidentally also the approximate diameter of the hawaii hotspot lihi consists of a summit area with three pit craters an 11 km (7 mi) long rift zone extending north from the summit and a 19 km (12 mi) long rift zone extending south-southeast from the summit
the summit's pit craters are named west pit east pit and pele's pit pele's pit is the youngest of this group and is located at the southern part of the summit the walls of pele's pit stand 200 m (700 ft) high and were formed in july 1996 when its predecessor pele's vent a hydrothermal field near lihi's summit collapsed into a large depression the thick crater walls of pele's pitaveraging 20 m (70 ft) in width unusually thick for hawaiian volcanic craterssuggest its craters have filled with lava multiple times in the past
lihi's northsouth trending rift zones create a distinctive elongated shape from which the volcano's hawaiian name meaning "long" derives the north rift zone consists of a longer western portion and a shorter eastern rift zone observations show that both the north and south rift zones lack sediment cover indicating recent activity a bulge in the western part of the north rift zone contains three 6080 m (200260 ft) cone-shaped prominences
until 1970 lihi was thought to be an inactive volcano that had been transported to its current location by sea-floor spreading the seafloor under hawaii is 80100 million years old and was created at the east pacific rise an oceanic spreading center where new sea floor forms from magma that erupts from the mantle new oceanic crust moves away from the spreading center over a period of 80100 million years the sea floor under hawaii moved from the east pacific rise to its present location 6,000 km (4,000 mi) west carrying ancient seamounts with it when scientists investigated a series of earthquakes off hawaii in 1970 they discovered that lihi was an active member of the hawaiian-emperor seamount chain
lihi is built on the seafloor with a slope of about five degrees its northern base on the flank of mauna loa is 1,900 m (6,200 ft) below sea level but its southern base is a more substantial 4,755 m (15,600 ft) below the surface thus the summit is 931 m (3,054 ft) above the seafloor as measured from the base of its north flank but 3,786 m (12,421 ft) high when measured from the base of its southern flank
lihi is following the pattern of development that is characteristic of all hawaiian volcanoes geochemical evidence from lihi lavas indicates that lihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage providing valuable clues to the early development of hawaiian volcanoes in the preshield stage hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and a lower level of activity producing an alkali basalt lava continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at lihi lihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face similar deposits from other hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of hawaiian volcanos' early development lihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years
=== age and growth ===
radiometric dating was used to determine the age of rock samples from lihi the hawaii center for volcanology tested samples recovered by various expeditions notably the 1978 expedition which provided 17 dredge samples most of the samples were found to be of ancient origin; the oldest dated rock is around 300,000 years old following the 1996 event some young breccia was also collected based on the samples scientists estimate lihi is about 400,000 years old the rock accumulates at an average rate of 3.5 mm (0.14 in) per year near the base and 7.8 mm (0.31 in) near the summit if the data model from other volcanoes such as klauea holds true for lihi 40% of the volcano's mass formed within the last 100,000 years assuming a linear growth rate lihi is 250,000 years old however as with all hotspot volcanoes lihi's level of activity has increased with time; therefore it would take at least 400,000 years for such a volcano to reach lihi's mass as hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest at a rate of about 10 cm (4 in) a year lihi was 40 km (25 mi) southeast of its current position at the time of its initial eruption
== activity ==
lihi is a young and fairly active volcano although less active than nearby klauea in the past few decades several earthquake swarms have been attributed to lihi the largest of which are summarized in the table below the volcano's activity is now known to predate scientific record keeping of its activity which commenced in 1959 most earthquake swarms at lihi have lasted less than two days; the two exceptions are the 199192 earthquake lasting several months and the 1996 event which was shorter but much more pronounced both of the earthquakes followed a pattern of activity that began on the flank and migrated to the summit the 1996 event was directly observed by an autonomous ocean bottom observatory (obo) allowing scientists to calculate the depth of the earthquakes as 6 km (4 mi) to 8 km (5 mi) below the summit approximating to the position of lihi's extremely shallow magma chamber this is evidence that lihi's seismicity is volcanic in origin
the low-level seismic activity documented on lihi since 1959 has shown that between two and ten earthquakes per month are traceable to the summit earthquake swarm data have been used to analyze how well lihi's rocks propagate seismic waves and to investigate the relationship between earthquakes and eruptions this low level activity is periodically punctuated by large swarms of earthquakes each swarm comprising up to hundreds of earthquakes the majority of the earthquakes are not distributed close to the summit though they follow a northsouth trend rather most of the earthquakes occur in the southwest portion of lihi the largest recorded swarms took place on lihi in 1971 1972 1975 199192 and 1996 the nearest seismic station is around 30 km (20 mi) from lihi on the south coast of hawaii seismic events that have a magnitude under 2 are recorded often but their location cannot be determined precisely as it can for larger events in fact hugo (hawaii undersea geological observatory) positioned on lihi's flank detected ten times as many earthquakes as were recorded by the hawaiian volcano observatory (hvo) seismic network
=== 1996 earthquake swarm ===
the largest amount of activity recorded for the lihi seamount was a swarm of 4,070 earthquakes between july 16 and august 9 1996 this series of earthquakes was the largest recorded for any hawaiian volcano to date in both amount and intensity most of the earthquakes had moment magnitudes of less than 3.0 "several hundred" had a magnitude greater than 3.0 including more than 40 greater than 4.0 and a 5.0 tremor
the final two weeks of the earthquake swarm were observed by a quick response cruise launched in august 1996 the national science foundation funded an expedition by university of hawaii scientists led by frederick duennebier that began investigating the swarm and its origin in august 1996 the scientists' assessment laid the groundwork for many of the expeditions that followed follow-up expeditions to lihi took place including a series of manned-submersible dives in august and september these were supplemented by a great deal of shore-based research fresh rock collected during the expedition revealed that an eruption occurred before the earthquake swarm
submersible dives in august were followed by noaa-funded research in september and october 1996 these more detailed studies showed the southern portion of lihi's summit had collapsed a result of a swarm of earthquakes and the rapid withdrawal of magma from the volcano a crater 1 km (0.6 mi) across and 300 m (1,000 ft) deep formed out of the rubble the event involved the movement of 100 million cubic meters of volcanic material a region of 10 to 13 km2 (4 to 5 sq mi) of the summit was altered and populated by bus-sized pillow lava blocks precariously perched along the outer rim of the newly formed crater "pele's vents," an area on the southern side previously considered stable collapsed completely into a giant pit renamed "pele's pit" strong currents make submersible diving hazardous in the region
the researchers were continually met by clouds of sulfide and sulfate the sudden collapse of pele's vents caused a large discharge of hydrothermal material the presence of certain indicator minerals in the mixture suggested temperatures exceeded 250 c a record for an underwater volcano the composition of the materials was similar to that of black smokers the hydrothermal vent plumes located along mid-ocean ridges samples from mounds built by discharges from the hydrothermal plumes resembled white smokers
the studies demonstrated that the most volcanically and hydrothermally active area was along the southern rift dives on the less active northern rim indicated that the terrain was more stable there and high lava columns were still standing upright a new hydrothermal vent field (naha vents) was located in the upper-south rift zone at a depth of 1,325 m (4,350 ft)
=== recent activity ===
lihi has remained largely quiet since the 1996 event; no activity was recorded from 2002 to 2004 the seamount showed signs of life again in 2005 by generating an earthquake bigger than any previously recorded there usgs-anss (advanced national seismic system) reported two earthquakes magnitudes 5.1 and 5.4 on may 13 and july 17 both originated from a depth of 44 km (27 mi) on april 23 a magnitude 4.3 earthquake was recorded at a depth of approximately 33 km (21 mi) between december 7 2005 and january 18 2006 a swarm of around 100 earthquakes occurred the largest measuring 4 on the moment magnitude scale and 12 km (7 mi) to 28 km (17 mi) deep another earthquake measuring 4.7 was later recorded approximately midway between lihi and phala (on the south coast of the island of hawaii)
== exploration ==
=== early work ===
lihi seamount's first depiction on a map was on survey chart 4115 a bathymetric rendering of part of hawaii compiled by the us coast and geodetic survey in 1940 at the time the seamount was non-notable being one of many in the region a large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952 that same year geologist gordon a macdonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano similar to the two active hawaiian volcanoes mauna loa and klauea macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the hawaiian-emperor seamount chain created by the hawaii hotspot however because the earthquakes were oriented eastwest (the direction of the volcanic fault) and there was no volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption
geologists suspected the seamount could be an active undersea volcano but without evidence the idea remained speculative the volcano was largely ignored after the 1952 event and was often mislabeled as an "older volcanic feature" in subsequent charts geologist kenneth o emery is credited with naming the seamount in 1955 describing the long and narrow shape of the volcano as loihi the hawaiian word lihi means "long" in 1978 an expedition studied intense repeated seismic activity known as earthquake swarms in and around the lihi area rather than finding an old extinct seamount data collected revealed lihi to be a young possibly active volcano observations showed the volcano to be encrusted with young and old lava flows fluids erupting from active hydrothermal vents were also found
in 1978 a us geological survey research ship collected dredge samples and photographed lihi's summit with the goal of studying whether lihi is active analysis of the photos and testing of pillow lava rock samples appeared to show that the material was "fresh" yielding more evidence that lihi is still active an expedition from october 1980 to january 1981 collected further dredge samples and photographs providing additional confirmation studies indicated that the eruptions came from the southern part of the rift crater this area is closest to the hawaii hotspot which supplies lihi with magma following a 1986 seismic event a network of five ocean bottom observatories (obos) were deployed on lihi for a month lihi's frequent seismicity makes it an ideal candidate for seismic study through obos in 1987 the submersible dsv alvin was used to survey lihi another autonomous observatory was positioned on lihi in 1991 to track earthquake swarms
=== 1996 to present ===
the bulk of information about lihi comes from dives made in response to the 1996 eruption in a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water the bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at pele's pit (formed from the collapse of the old ones) and may be indicators of the kinds of material ejected from the newly formed vents they were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory an obo briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed
repeated multibeam bathymetric mapping was used to measure the changes in the summit following the 1996 collapse hydrothermal plume surveys confirmed changes in the energy and dissolved minerals emanating from lihi hawaii undersea research laboratory hurl's 2,000 m (6,562 ft) submersible pisces v allowed scientists to sample the vent waters microorganisms and hydrothermal mineral deposits
in 1997 scientists from the university of hawaii installed an ocean bottom observatory (obo) on the summit of lihi seamount the submarine observatory was nicknamed hugo (hawaii undersea geological observatory) hugo was connected to the shore 34 km (21 mi) away by a fiber optic cable it gave scientists real-time seismic chemical and visual data about the state of lihi which had by then become an international laboratory for the study of undersea volcanism the cable that provided hugo with power and communications broke in october 1998 effectively shutting it down on january 19 of the following year hugo was visited by pisces v the observatory functioned for four years before it went dead again in 2002
since 2006 the fe-oxidizing microbial observatory (femo) funded by the national science foundation and microbial observatory program has led cruises to lihi investigate its microbiology every october the first cruise on the ship r/v melville and exploiting the submersible jason2 lasted from september 22 to october 9 these cruises study the large number of fe-oxidizing bacteria that have colonized lihi lihi's extensive vent system is characterized by a high concentration of co2 and iron while being low in sulfide these characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria called feob to thrive in
== ecology ==
=== hydrothermal vent geochemistry ===
lihi's mid-pacific location and its well-sustained hydrothermal system contribute to a rich oasis for a microbial ecosystem areas of extensive hydrothermal venting are found on lihi's crater floor and north slope and along the summit of lihi itself active hydrothermal vents were first discovered at lihi in the late 1980s these vents are remarkably similar to those found at the mid-ocean ridges with similar composition and thermal differences the two most prominent vent fields are at the summit: pele's pit (formally pele's vents) and kapo's vents they are named after the hawaiian deity pele and her sister kapo these vents were considered "low temperature vents" because their waters were only about 30 c the volcanic eruption of 1996 and the creation of pele's pit changed this and initiated high temperature venting; exit temperatures were measured at 77 c in 1996
=== microorganisms ===
the vents lie 1,100 m (3,600 ft) to 1,325 m (4,347 ft) below the surface and range in temperature from 10 to over 200 c the vent fluids are characterized by a high concentration of co
2 (up to 17 mm) and fe (iron) but low in sulfide low oxygen and ph levels are important factors in supporting the high amounts of fe (iron) one of the hallmark features of lihi these characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria called feob to thrive in an example of these species is mariprofundus ferrooxydans sole member of the class zetaproteobacteria the composition of the materials was similar to that of black smokers that are a habitat of archaea extremophiles dissolution and oxidation of the mineral observed over the next two years suggests the sulfate is not easily preserved
a diverse community of microbial mats surround the vents and virtually cover pele's pit the hawaii undersea research laboratory (hurl) noaa's research center for hawaii and the western pacific monitors and researches the hydrothermal systems and studies the local community the national science foundation (nsf) funded an extremophile sampling expedition to lihi in 1999 microbial mats surrounded the 160 c vents and included a novel jelly-like organism samples were collected for study at nsf's marine bioproducts engineering center (marbec) in 2001 pisces v collected samples of the organisms and brought them to the surface for study
noaa's national undersea research center and nsf's marine bioproducts engineering center are cooperating to sample and research the local bacteria and archaea extremophiles the fourth femo (fe-oxidizing microbial observatory) cruise occurred during october 2009
=== macroorganisms ===
marine life inhabiting the waters around lihi is not as diverse as life at other less active seamounts fish found living near lihi include the celebes monkfish (sladenia remiger) and members of the cutthroat eel family synaphobranchidae invertebrates identified in the area include two species endemic to the hydrothermal vents a bresiliid shrimp (opaepele loihi) of the family alvinocarididae (described in 1995) and a tube or pogonophoran worm dives conducted after the 1996 earthquake swarms were unable to find either the shrimp or the worm and it is not known if there are lasting effects on these species
from 1982 to 1992 researchers in hawaii undersea research laboratory submersibles photographed the fish of lihi seamount johnston atoll and cross seamount at depths between 40 m (130 ft) and 2,000 m (6,600 ft) a small number of species identified at lihi were newly recorded sightings in hawaii including the tassled coffinfish (chaunax fimbriatus) and the celebes monkfish
