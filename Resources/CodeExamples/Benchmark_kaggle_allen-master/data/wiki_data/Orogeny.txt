orogeny refers to forces and events leading to a large structural deformation of the earth's lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle) due to the interaction between tectonic plates orogens or orogenic belts develop when a continental plate is crumpled and is pushed upwards to form mountain ranges and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called orogenesis the word "orogeny" comes from the greek (oros for "mountain" plus genesis for "creation" or "origin") and it is the primary mechanism by which mountains are built on continents geomorphology is the study of landforms and the processes that shape them
== physiographyedit ==
formation of an orogen is accomplished in part by the tectonic processes of subduction where a continent rides forcefully over an oceanic plate (noncollisional orogens) or convergence of two or more continents (collisional orogens)
orogeny usually produces long arcuate (from arcuare to bend like a bow) structures known as orogenic belts generally orogenic belts consist of long parallel strips of rock exhibiting similar characteristics along the length of the belt orogenic belts are associated with subduction zones which consume crust produce volcanoes and build island arcs the arcuate structure is attributed to the rigidity of the descending plate and island arc cusps are related to tears in the descending lithosphere these island arcs may be added to a continent during an orogenic event
the processes of orogeny can take tens of millions of years and build mountains from plains or the ocean floor the topographic height of orogenic mountains is related to the principle of isostasy that is a balance of the downward gravitational force upon an upthrust mountain range (composed of light continental crust material) and the buoyant upward forces exerted by the dense underlying mantle
frequently rock formations that undergo orogeny are severely deformed and undergo metamorphism during orogeny deeply buried rocks may be pushed to the surface sea bottom and near shore material may cover some or all of the orogenic area if the orogeny is due to two continents colliding the resulting mountains can be very high (see himalayas)
an orogenic event may be studied as: (a) a tectonic structural event (b) as a geographical event and (c) a chronological event orogenic events: (a) cause distinctive structural phenomena related to tectonic activity (b) affect rocks and crust in particular regions and (c) happen within a specific period
=== orogen (or "orogenic system")edit ===
an orogeny produces an orogen or (mountain) range-foreland basin system
the foreland basin forms ahead of the orogen due mainly to loading and resulting flexure of the lithosphere by the developing mountain belt a typical foreland basin is subdivided into a wedge-top basin above the active orogenic wedge the foredeep immediately beyond the active front a forebulge high of flexural origin and a back-bulge area beyond although not all of these are present in all foreland basin systems the basin migrates with the orogenic front and early deposited foreland basin sediments become progressively involved in folding and thrusting sediments deposited in the foreland basin are mainly derived from the erosion of the actively uplifting rocks of the mountain range although some sediments are derived from the foreland the fill of many such basins shows a change in time from deepwater marine (flysch-style) through shallow water to continental (molasse-style) sediments
=== orogenic cycleedit ===
although orogeny involves plate tectonics the tectonic forces result in a variety of associated phenomena including magmatism metamorphism crustal melting and crustal thickening what exactly happens in a specific orogen depends upon the strength and rheology of the continental lithosphere and how these properties change during orogenesis
in addition to orogeny the orogen once formed is subject to other processes such as sedimentation and erosion the sequence of repeated cycles of sedimentation deposition and erosion followed by burial and metamorphism and then by formation of granitic batholiths and tectonic uplift to form mountain chains is called the orogenic cycle for example the caledonian orogeny refers to the silurian and devonian events that resulted from the collision of laurentia with eastern avalonia and other former fragments of gondwana the caledonian orogen resulted from these events and various others that are part of its peculiar orogenic cycle
in summary an orogeny is a long-lived deformational episode during which many geological phenomena play a role the orogeny of an orogen is only part of the orogen's orogenic cycle
=== erosionedit ===
erosion is a subsequent phase of the orogenic cycle erosion inevitably removes much of the mountains exposing the core or mountain roots (metamorphic rocks brought to the surface from a depth of several kilometres) such exhumation may be helped by isostatic movements balancing out the buoyancy of the evolving orogen debate exists about the extent to which erosion modifies the patterns of tectonic deformation (see erosion and tectonics) thus the final form of the majority of old orogenic belts is a long arcuate strip of crystalline metamorphic rocks sequentially below younger sediments which are thrust atop them and dip away from the orogenic core
an orogen may be almost completely eroded away and only recognizable by studying (old) rocks that bear traces of orogenesis orogens are usually long thin arcuate tracts of rock that have a pronounced linear structure resulting in terranes or blocks of deformed rocks separated generally by suture zones or dipping thrust faults these thrust faults carry relatively thin slices of rock (which are called nappes or thrust sheets and differ from tectonic plates) from the core of the shortening orogen out toward the margins and are intimately associated with folds and the development of metamorphism
=== biologyedit ===
the study of orogeny coupled with biogeography (the study of the distribution and evolution of flora and fauna) geography and mid ocean ridges in the 1950s and 1960s contributed greatly to the theory of plate tectonics even at a very early stage life played a significant role in the continued existence of oceans by affecting the composition of the atmosphere the existence of oceans is critical to sea-floor spreading and subduction
=== relationship to mountain buildingedit ===
mountain formation occurs through a number of mechanisms
mountain complexes result from irregular successions of tectonic responses due to sea-floor spreading shifting lithosphere plates transform faults and colliding coupled and uncoupled continental margins
large modern orogenies often lie on the margins of continents; the alleghenian (appalachian) laramide and andean orogenies are examples of these in the americas older inactive orogenies such as the algoman penokean and antler are represented by deformed rocks and sedimentary basins further inland
areas that are rifting apart such as mid-ocean ridges and the east african rift have mountains due to thermal buoyancy related to the hot mantle underneath them; this thermal buoyancy is known as dynamic topography in strike-slip orogens such as the san andreas fault restraining bends result in regions of localized crustal shortening and mountain building without a plate-margin-wide orogeny hotspot volcanism results in the formation of isolated mountains and mountain chains that are not necessarily on tectonic plate boundaries
regions can also experience uplift as a result of delamination of the lithosphere in which an unstable portion of cold lithospheric root drips down into the mantle decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift an example is the sierra nevada in california this range of fault-block mountains experienced renewed uplift after a delamination of the lithosphere beneath them
finally uplift and erosion related to epeirogenesis (large-scale vertical motions of portions of continents without much associated folding metamorphism or deformation) can create local topographic highs
mount rundle on the transcanada highway between banff and canmore provides a classic example of a mountain cut in dipping-layered rocks millions of years ago a collision caused an orogeny forcing horizontal layers of an ancient ocean crust to be thrust up at an angle of 5060 that left rundle with one sweeping tree-lined smooth face and one sharp steep face where the edge of the uplifted layers are exposed
the collision causing the columbia orogeny occurred about 175 million years ago and as the shock wave moved eastward it forced huge masses of rock to crack and slide up over its neighbours this is known as thrust faulting and was instrumental in the formation of the rockies the shock wave began piling up the western ranges and then the main ranges around 120 million years ago
== history of the conceptedit ==
before the development of geologic concepts during the 19th century the presence of marine fossils in mountains was explained in christian contexts as a result of the biblical deluge this was an extension of neoplatonic thought which influenced early christian writers the 13th-century dominican scholar albert the great posited that as erosion was known to occur there must be some process whereby new mountains and other land-forms were thrust up or else there would eventually be no land; he suggested that marine fossils in mountainsides must once have been at the sea-floor
orogeny was used by amanz gressly (1840) and jules thurmann (1854) as orogenic in terms of the creation of mountain elevations as the term mountain building was still used to describe the processes
elie de beaumont (1852) used the evocative "jaws of a vise" theory to explain orogeny but was more concerned with the height rather than the implicit structures created by and contained in orogenic belts his theory essentially held that mountains were created by the squeezing of certain rocks
eduard suess (1875) recognised the importance of horizontal movement of rocks the concept of a precursor geosyncline or initial downward warping of the solid earth (hall 1859) prompted james dwight dana (1873) to include the concept of compression in the theories surrounding mountain-building with hindsight we can discount dana's conjecture that this contraction was due to the cooling of the earth (aka the cooling earth theory)
the cooling earth theory was the chief paradigm for most geologists until the 1960s it was in the context of orogeny fiercely contested by proponents of vertical movements in the crust (similar to tephrotectonics) or convection within the asthenosphere or mantle
gustav steinmann (1906) recognised different classes of orogenic belts including the alpine type orogenic belt typified by a flysch and molasse geometry to the sediments; ophiolite sequences tholeiitic basalts and a nappe style fold structure
in terms of recognising orogeny as an event leopold von buch (1855) recognised that orogenies could be placed in time by bracketing between the youngest deformed rock and the oldest undeformed rock a principle which is still in use today though commonly investigated by geochronology using radiometric dating
h.j zwart (1967) drew attention to the metamorphic differences in orogenic belts proposing three types modified by w s pitcher in 1979 and further modified as:
hercynotype (back-arc basin type);
shallow low-pressure metamorphism; thin metamorphic zones
metamorphism dependent on increase in temperature
abundant granite and migmatite
few ophiolites ultramafic rocks virtually absent
very wide orogen with small and slow uplift
nappe structures rare
alpinotype (ocean trench style);
deep high pressure thick metamorphic zones
metamorphism of many facies dependent on decrease in pressure
few granites or migmatites
abundant ophiolites with ultramafic rocks
relatively narrow orogen with large and rapid uplift
nappe structures predominant
cordilleran (arc) type;
dominated by calc-alkaline igneous rocks andesites granite batholiths
general lack of migmatites low geothermal gradient
lack of ophiolite and abyssal sedimentary rocks (black shale chert etcetera)
low-pressure metamorphism moderate uplift
lack of nappes
the advent of plate tectonics has explained the vast majority of orogenic belts and their features the cooling earth theory (principally advanced by descartes) is dispensed with and tephrotectonic style vertical movements have been explained primarily by the process of isostasy
some oddities exist where simple collisional tectonics are modified in a transform plate boundary such as in new zealand or where island arc orogenies for instance in new guinea occur away from a continental backstop further complications such as proterozoic continent-continent collisional orogens explicitly the musgrave block in australia previously inexplicable (see dennis 1982) are being brought to light with the advent of seismic imaging techniques which can resolve the deep crust structure of orogenic belts
