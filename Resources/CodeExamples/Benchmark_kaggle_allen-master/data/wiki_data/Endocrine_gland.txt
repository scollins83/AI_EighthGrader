endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products hormones directly into the blood rather than through a duct the major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland pituitary gland pancreas ovaries testes thyroid gland parathyroid gland hypothalamus and adrenal glands the hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs local chemical messengers not generally considered part of the endocrine system include autocrines which act on the cells that secrete them and paracrines which act on a different cell type nearby
the ability of a target cell to respond to a hormone depends on the presence of receptors within the cell or on its plasma membrane to which the hormone can bind
hormone receptors are dynamic structures changes in number and sensitivity of hormone receptors may occur in response to high or low levels of stimulating hormones
blood levels of hormones reflect a balance between secretion and degradation/excretion the liver and kidneys are the major organs that degrade hormones; breakdown products are excreted in urine and feces
hormone half-life and duration of activity are limited and vary from hormone to hormone
== interaction of hormones at target cellsedit ==
permissiveness is the situation in which a hormone cannot exert its full effects without the presence of another hormone
synergyism occurs when two or more hormones produce the same effects in a target cell and their results are amplified
antagonism occurs when a hormone opposes or reverses the effect of another hormone
== control of hormone releaseedit ==
endocrine organs are activated to release their hormones by humoral neural or hormonal stimuli negative feedback is important in regulating hormone levels in the blood
the nervous system acting through hypothalamic controls can in certain cases override or modulate hormonal effects

=== pituitary gland (hypophysis)edit ===
the pituitary gland hangs from the base of the brain by a stalk and is enclosed by bone it consists of a hormone-producing glandular portion (anterior pituitary) and a neural portion (posterior pituitary) which is an extension of the hypothalamus the hypothalamus regulates the hormonal output of the anterior pituitary and synthesizes two hormones that it exports to the posterior pituitary for storage and later release
four of the six adenohypophyseal hormones are tropic hormones that regulate the function of other endocrine organs most anterior pituitary hormones exhibit a diurnal rhythm of release which is subject to modification by stimuli influencing the hypothalamus
somatotropic hormone or growth hormone (gh) is an anabolic hormone that stimulates growth of all body tissues but especially skeletal muscle and bone it may act directly or indirectly via insulin-like growth factors (igfs) gh mobilizes fats stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits glucose uptake and metabolism secretion is regulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (ghrh) and growth hormone inhibiting hormone (ghih) or somatostatin hypersecretion causes gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults; hyposecretion in children causes pituitary dwarfism
thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) promotes normal development and activity of the thyroid gland thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) stimulates its release; negative feedback of thyroid hormone inhibits it
adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) stimulates the adrenal cortex to release corticosteroids acth release is triggered by corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) and inhibited by rising glucocorticoid levels
the gonadotropinsfollicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) regulate the functions of the gonads in both sexes fsh stimulates sex cell production; lh stimulates gonadal hormone production gonadotropin levels rise in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) negative feedback of gonadal hormones inhibits gonadotropin release
prolactin (prl) promotes milk production in humans females its secretion is prompted by prolactin-releasing hormone (prh) and inhibited by prolactin-inhibiting hormone (pih)
the neurohypophysis stores and releases two hypothalamic hormones:
oxytocin stimulates powerful uterine contractions which trigger labor and delivery of an infant and milk ejection in nursing women its release is mediated reflexively by the hypothalamus and represents a positive feedback mechanism
antidiuretic hormone (adh) stimulates the kidney tubules to reabsorb and conserve water resulting in small volumes of highly concentrated urine and decreased plasma osmolarity adh is released in response to high solute concentrations in the blood and inhibited by low solute concentrations in the blood hyposecretion results in diabetes insipidus
=== thyroid glandedit ===
the thyroid gland is located in the anterior throat thyroid follicles store colloid containing thyroglobulin a glycoprotein from which thyroid hormone is derived
thyroid hormone (th) includes thyroxine (t4) and triiodothyronine (t3) which increase the rate of cellular metabolism consequently oxygen use and heat production rise
secretion of thyroid hormone prompted by tsh requires reuptake of the stored colloid by the follicle cells and splitting of the hormones from the colloid for release rising levels of thyroid hormone feed back to inhibit the pituitary and hypothalamus
most t4 is converted to t3 (the more active form) in the target tissues these hormones act by turning on gene and protein synthesis
graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism; hyposecretion causes cretinism in infants and myxoedema in adults
calcitonin produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland in response to rising blood calcium levels depresses blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone matrix resorption and enhancing calcium deposit in bone
=== parathyroid glandsedit ===
the parathyroid glands located on the dorsal aspect of the thyroid gland secrete parathyroid hormone (pth) which causes an increase in blood calcium levels by targeting bone the intestine and the kidneys pth is the antagonist of calcitonin pth release is triggered by falling blood calcium levels and is inhibited by rising blood calcium levels
hyperparathyroidism results in hypercalcaemia and all its effects and in extreme bone wasting hypoparathyroidism leads to hypocalcaemia evidenced by tetany and respiratory paralysis
=== pancreasedit ===
the pancreas located in the abdomen close to the stomach is both an exocrine and an endocrine gland the endocrine portion (islets of langerhans) releases insulin and glucagon and smaller amounts of other hormones to the blood
glucagon released by alpha () cells when glucose level in blood are low stimulates the liver to release glucose to the blood
insulin is released by beta () cells when blood levels of glucose (and amino acids) are rising it increases the rate of glucose uptake and metabolism by most body cells hyposecretion of insulin results in diabetes mellitus; cardinal signs are polyuria polydipsia and polyphagia
=== gonadsedit ===
the ovaries of the female located in the pelvic cavity release two main hormones secretion of estrogens by the ovarian follicles begins at puberty under the influence of fsh estrogens stimulate maturation of the female reproductive system and development of the secondary sexual characteristics progesterone is released in response to high blood levels of lh it works with estrogens in establishing the menstrual cycle
the testes of the male begin to produce testosterone at puberty in response to lh testosterone promotes maturation of the male reproductive organs development of secondary sex characteristics and production of sperm by the testes
=== pineal glandedit ===
the pineal gland is located in the diencephalon its primary hormone is melatonin which influences daily rhythms and may have an antigonadotropic effect in humans
== other hormone-producing structuresedit ==
many body organs not normally considered endocrine organs contain isolated cell clusters that secrete hormones examples include the heart (atrial natriuretic peptide); gastrointestinal tract organs (gastrin secretin and others); the placenta (hormones of pregnancyestrogen progesterone and others); the kidneys (erythropoietin and renin); the thymus; skin (cholecalciferol); and adipose tissue (leptin and resistin)
== developmental aspects of the endocrine systemsedit ==
endocrine glands derive from all three germ layers those derived from mesoderm produce steroidal hormones; the others produce the amino acidbased hormones
the natural decrease in function of the females ovaries during late middle age results in menopause the efficiency of all endocrine glands seems to decrease gradually as aging occurs this leads to a generalized increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus and a lower metabolic rate
