technological evolution as an innovation- and technology-related theory describes technology development the czech philosopher radovan richta (19241983) originated the theory
== theory of technological evolution ==
mankind in transition; a view of the distant past the present and the far future masefield books 1993 technology (which richta defines as "a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value") evolves in three stages: tools machine automation this evolution he says follows two trends: 
=== development ===
the pretechnological period in which all other animal species remain today aside from some avian and primate species was a non-rational period of the early prehistoric man
the emergence of technology made possible by the development of the rational faculty paved the way for the first stage: the tool a tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task such as an arrow plow or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one's body alone such as seeing minute visual detail with a microscope manipulating heavy objects with a pulley and cart or carrying volumes of water in a bucket
the second technological stage was the creation of the machine a machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes the element of human physical effort and requires only to control its function machines became widespread with the industrial revolution though windmills a type of machine are much older
examples of this include cars trains computers and lights machines allow humans to tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies putting a machine on the farm a tractor increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse
the third and final stage of technological evolution is the automation the automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are digital watches automatic telephone switches pacemakers and computer programs
it's important to understand that the three stages outline the introduction of the fundamental types of technology and so all three continue to be widely used today a spear a plow a pen and an optical microscope are all examples of tools
=== theoretical implications ===
the process of technological evolution culminates with the ability to achieve all the material values technologically possible and desirable by mental effort
an economic implication of the above idea is that intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour contracts and agreements around information will become increasingly more common at the marketplace expansion and creation of new kinds of institutes that works with information such as for example universities book stores patent-trading companies etc is considered an indication that a civilization is in technological evolution
this highlights the importance underlining the debate over intellectual property in conjunction with decentralized distribution systems such as today's internet where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever more efficient tools to distribute information is being invented growing amounts of information being distributed to an increasingly larger customer base as times goes by with growing disintermediation in said markets and growing concerns over the protection of intellectual property rights it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age
