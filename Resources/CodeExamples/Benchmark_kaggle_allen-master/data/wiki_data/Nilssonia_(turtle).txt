nilssonia is a genus of softshell turtles (family trionychidae) from rivers streams ponds and lakes in south asia and burma in many treatments it is monotypic with the single species burmese peacock softshell (n formosa) however the supposed other genus of peacock softshells aspideretes is more closely related to n formosa than had been believed they differ only in the neural plates between the first pleural scale pair of the bony carapace which are fused into one in n formosa and unfused in the others
thus it has been proposed to unite the two genera under the older name nilssonia as it seems the closest living relatives of the burmese peacock softshell are the indian softshell turtle (a./n gangeticus) and the leith's softshell turtle (a./n leithii) making the merging of the genera well warranted
== species ==
if the genera are united the five species are:
burmese peacock softshell or burmese softshell turtle n formosa (gray 1869)
indian softshell turtle or ganges softshell turtle n gangetica (cuvier 1825)
indian peacock softshell turtle n hurum (gray 1831)
leith's softshell turtle or nagpur softshell turtle n leithii (gray 1872)
black softshell turtle or bostami turtle n nigricans (anderson 1875)
