glacial landforms are landforms created by the action of glaciers most of today's glacial landforms were created by the movement of large ice sheets during the quaternary glaciations some areas like fennoscandia and the southern andes have extensive occurrences of glacial landforms; other areas such as the sahara display very old fossil glacial landforms
== erosional landforms ==
as the glaciers expanded due to their accumulating weight of snow and ice they crush and abrade scoured surface rocks and bedrock the resulting erosional landforms include striations cirques glacial horns artes trim lines u-shaped valleys roches moutonnes overdeepenings and hanging valleys
cirque: starting location for mountain glaciers
cirque stairway: a sequence of cirques
u-shaped valley: u-shaped valleys are created by mountain glaciers when filled with ocean water so as to create an inlet these valleys are called fjords
arte: spiky high land between two glaciers if the glacial action erodes through a spillway (or col) forms
== depositional landforms ==
later when the glaciers retreated leaving behind their freight of crushed rock and sand (glacial drift) they created characteristic depositional landforms examples include glacial moraines eskers and kames drumlins and ribbed moraines are also landforms left behind by retreating glaciers the stone walls of new england contain many glacial erratics rocks that were dragged by a glacier many miles from their bedrock origin
esker: built up bed of a sub-glacial stream
kame: irregularly shaped mound
moraine: feature can be terminal (at the end of a glacier) lateral (along the sides of a glacier) or medial (formed by the emerger of lateral moraines from contributary glaciers)
outwash fan: braided stream flowing from the front end of a glacier
== glacial lakes and ponds ==
lakes and ponds may also be caused by glacial movement kettle lakes form when a retreating glacier leaves behind an underground or surface chunk of ice that later melts to form a depression containing water moraine-dammed lakes occur when glacial debris dam a stream (or snow runoff) jackson lake and jenny lake in grand teton national park are examples of moraine-dammed lakes though jackson lake is enhanced by a man-made dam
kettle lake: depression formed by a block of ice separated from the main glacier in which the lake forms
tarn: a lake formed in a cirque by overdeepening
paternoster lake: a series of lakes in a glacial valley formed when a stream is dammed by successive terminal moraines left by an advancing or retreating glacier
glacial lake: a lake that formed between the front of a glacier and the last terminal moraine
== ice features ==
apart from the landforms left behind by glaciers glaciers themselves may be striking features of the terrain particularly in the polar regions of the earth notable examples include valley glaciers where glacial flow is restricted by the valley walls crevasses in the upper section of glacial ice and icefallsthe ice equivalent of waterfalls
