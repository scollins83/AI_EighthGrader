the peripheral nervous system (pns) is the part of the nervous system that consists of the nerves and ganglia on the outside of the brain and spinal cord the main function of the pns is to connect the central nervous system (cns) to the limbs and organs essentially serving as a communication relay going back and forth between the brain and the extremities unlike the cns the pns is not protected by the bone of spine and skull or by the bloodbrain barrier which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system; some textbooks also include sensory systems the cranial nerves are part of the pns with the exception of cranial nerve ii the optic nerve along with the retina the second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon cranial nerve ganglia originate in the cns however the remaining twelve cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the pns
== specific nerves and plexusesedit ==
ten out of the twelve cranial nerves originate from the brainstem and mainly control the functions of the anatomic structures of the head with some exceptions the nuclei of cranial nerves i and ii lie in the forebrain and thalamus respectively and are thus not considered to be true cranial nerves cn x (10) receives visceral sensory information from the thorax and abdomen and cn xi (11) is responsible for innervating the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles neither of which being exclusively in the head
spinal nerves take their origins from the spinal cord they control the functions of the rest of the body in humans there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical 12 thoracic 5 lumbar 5 sacral and 1 coccygeal in the cervical region the spinal nerve roots come out above the corresponding vertebrae (i.e. nerve root between the skull and 1st cervical vertebrae is called spinal nerve c1) from the thoracic region to the coccygeal region the spinal nerve roots come out below the corresponding vertebrae it is important to note that this method creates a problem when naming the spinal nerve root between c7 and t1 (so it is called spinal nerve root c8) in the lumbar and sacral region the spinal nerve roots travel within the dural sac and they travel below the level of l2 as the cauda equina
=== cervical spinal nerves (c1c4)edit ===
the first 4 cervical spinal nerves c1 through c4 split and recombine to produce a variety of nerves that subserve the neck and back of head
spinal nerve c1 is called the suboccipital nerve which provides motor innervation to muscles at the base of the skull c2 and c3 form many of the nerves of the neck providing both sensory and motor control these include the greater occipital nerve which provides sensation to the back of the head the lesser occipital nerve which provides sensation to the area behind the ears the greater auricular nerve and the lesser auricular nerve see occipital neuralgia the phrenic nerve arises from nerve roots c3 c4 and c5 it innervates the diaphragm enabling breathing if the spinal cord is transected above c3 then spontaneous breathing is not possible see myelopathy
=== brachial plexus (c5t1)edit ===
the last four cervical spinal nerves c5 through c8 and the first thoracic spinal nerve t1 combine to form the brachial plexus or plexus brachialis a tangled array of nerves splitting combining and recombining to form the nerves that subserve the upper-limb and upper back although the brachial plexus may appear tangled it is highly organized and predictable with little variation between people see brachial plexus injuries
=== lumbosacral plexus (l1s4)edit ===
the anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves sacral nerves and coccygeal nerve form the lumbosacral plexus the first lumbar nerve being frequently joined by a branch from the twelfth thoracic for descriptive purposes this plexus is usually divided into three parts:
lumbar plexus
sacral plexus
pudendal plexus
== neurotransmittersedit ==
the main neurotransmitters of the peripheral nervous system are acetylcholine and noradrenaline however there are several other neurotransmitters as well jointly labeled non-noradrenergic non-cholinergic (nanc) transmitters examples of such transmitters include non-peptides: atp gaba dopamine no and peptides: neuropeptide y vip gnrh substance p and cgrp
