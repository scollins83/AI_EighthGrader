the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to earth science:
earth science all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet earth it is also known as geoscience the geosciences or the earth sciences and is arguably a special case in planetary science the earth being the only known life-bearing planet
earth science is a branch of the physical sciences which is a part of the natural sciences it in turn has many branches
== earth's spheres ==
ecosphere there are many subsystems that make up the natural environment (the planetary ecosystem or "ecosphere") of the earth many of the subsystems are characterized as "spheres" coinciding with the shape of the planet the four spheres (for which most of the other spheres are a subtype of) are the atmosphere the biosphere the hydrosphere and the geosphere listed roughly from outermost to innermost the named spheres of the earth are:
magnetosphere
atmosphere the gases that surround the earth (its air)
by altitude
exosphere
exobase
ionosphere
thermopause
thermosphere
mesopause
mesosphere
stratopause
stratosphere
ozone layer
tropopause
troposphere
planetary boundary layer
by air turbulence
heterosphere
turbopause
homosphere
biosphere all life on earth
anthroposphere
noosphere (rare)
cryosphere those portions of earth's surface where water is in solid form including sea ice lake ice river ice snow cover glaciers ice caps ice sheets and frozen ground (which includes permafrost) thus there is a wide overlap with the hydrosphere
hydrosphere all water found on under and over the surface of earth
pedosphere
geosphere/solid earth
lithosphere
crust (geology)
asthenosphere
mesosphere
earth's mantle
earth's core
inner core
outer core
