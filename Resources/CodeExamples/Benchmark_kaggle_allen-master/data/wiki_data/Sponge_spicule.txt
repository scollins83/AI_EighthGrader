spicules are structural elements found in most sponges they provide structural support and deter predators large spicules that are visible to the naked eye are referred to as megascleres while smaller microscopic ones are termed microscleres
== structure ==
spicules are found in a range of symmetry types
monaxons form simple cylinders with pointed ends the ends of diactinal monaxons are similar whereas monactinal monaxons have a different ends - one pointed one rounded diactinal monaxons are classified by the nature of their ends: oxea have pointed ends and strongyles are rounded spine-covered oxea and strongyles are termed acanthoxea and acanthostrongyles respectively monactical monaxons always have one pointed end; they are termed styles if the other end is blunt tylostyles if their blunt end forms a knob; and acanthostyles if they are covered in spines
triaxons have three axes; in triods each axis bears a similar ray; in pentacts the triaxon has five rays four of which lie in a single plane; and pinnules are pentacts with large spines on the non-planar ray
tetraxons have four axes and polyaxons more (description of types to be incorporated from ) sigma-c spicules have the shape of a c
dendroclones might be unique to extinct sponges and are branching spicules that may take irregular forms or may form structures with an i y or x shape
== spicule types ==
megascleres are large spicules measuring from 60-2000 m and often function as the main support elements in the skeleton
acanthostyles are spiny styles
anatriaenes orthotriaenes and protriaenes are triaenes - megascleres with one long and three short rays
strongyles are megascleres with both ends blunt or rounded
styles are megascleres with one end pointed and the other end rounded
tornotes are megascleres with spear shaped ends
tylotes are megascleres with knobs on both ends
microscleres are small spicules measuring from 10-60 m and are scattered throughout the tissue and are not part of the main support element
anisochelas are microscleres with dissimilar ends
chelae are microscleres with shovel-like structures on the ends
euasters are star-shaped microscleres with multiple rays radiating from a common centre
forceps are microscleres bent back on themselves
isochelas are microscleres with two similar ends
microstrongyles are microscleres with both ends blunt or rounded
oxeas are microscleres with both ends pointed
oxyasters are star-shaped microscleres with thin pointed rays
sigmas are "c" or "s" shaped microscleres
spherasters are microscleres with multiple rays radiating from a spherical centre
== composition ==
sponges can be calcareous siliceous or composed of spongin
== function ==
the meshing of many spicules serves as the sponges skeleton
== taxonomic importance ==
the composition size and shape of spicules is one of the largest determining factors in sponge taxonomy
== formation ==
spicules are formed by sclerocytes which are derived from archaeocytes the sclerocyte begins with an organic filament and adds silica to it spicules are generally elongated at a rate of 1-10 m per hour once the spicule reaches a certain length it protrudes from the sclerocyte cell body but remains within the cells membrane on occasion sclerocytes may begin a second spicule while the first is still in progress
== interaction with light ==
research on the euplectella aspergillum (venus' flower basket) demonstrated that the spicules of certain deep-sea sponges have similar traits to optical fibre in addition to being able to trap and transport light these spicules have a number of advantages over commercial fibre optic wire they are stronger resist stress easier and form their own support elements also the low-temperature formation of the spicules as compared to the high temperature stretching process of commercial fibre optics allows for the addition of impurities which improve the refractive index in addition these spicules have built-in lenses in the ends which gather and focus light in dark conditions it has been theorized that this ability may function as a light source for symbiotic algae (as with rosella racovitzae) or as an attractor for shrimp which live inside the venus' flower basket however a conclusive decision has not been reached; it may be that the light capabilities are simply a coincidental trait from a purely structural element spicules funnel light deep inside sea sponges
