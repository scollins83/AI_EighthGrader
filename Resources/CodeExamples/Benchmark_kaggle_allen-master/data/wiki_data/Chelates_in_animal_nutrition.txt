chelates ( chelate ) [kee-leyt] in animal feed are organic forms of essential trace minerals such as copper iron manganese and zinc
animals absorb digest and use mineral chelates better than inorganic minerals this means that lower concentrations can be used in animal feeds in addition animals fed chelated sources of essential trace minerals excrete lower amounts in their faeces and so there is less environmental contamination mineral chelates also offers health and welfare benefits in animal nutrition
== brief history of chelates ==
since the 1950s animal feeds have been supplemented with essential trace minerals such as copper (cu) iron (fe) iodine (i) manganese (mn) molybdenum (mo) selenium (se) and zinc (zn) initially such supplementation was by means of inorganic salts of essential trace elements from the 1960s onwards genetic improvement of farm livestock resulted in increased nutritional requirements for these nutrients chelated minerals were developed in the 1980s and 1990s trace mineral chelates have proven to be better than inorganic minerals in meeting the nutritional needs of modern farm animals
== role and source of minerals ==
the objective of supplementation with trace minerals is to avoid a variety of deficiency diseases trace minerals carry out key functions in relation to many metabolic processes most notably as catalysts for enzymes and hormones and are essential for optimum health growth and productivity for example supplementary minerals help ensure good growth bone development feathering in birds hoof skin and hair quality in mammals enzyme structure and functions and appetite deficiency of trace minerals affect many metabolic processes and so may be manifested by different symptoms such as poor growth and appetite reproductive failures impaired immune responses and general ill-thrift from the 1950s to the 1990s most trace mineral supplementation of animal diets was in the form of inorganic minerals and these largely eradicated associated deficiency diseases in farm animals
the role in fertility and reproductive diseases of dairy cattle highlights that organic forms of zn are retained better than inorganic sources and so may provide greater benefit in disease prevention notably mastitis and lameness
=== sources of essential minerals ===
in recent decades global food animal production has intensified and genetic potential for growth and yields has improved as a result commercial tendencies have been to increase trace mineral supplementation,in order to allow for the greater mineral requirements of superior stock reared under industrial conditions increasing the concentration of inorganic minerals in animal diets has led to several problems
the use of high cu in swine and poultry rations has caused accidental cu poisoning in more sensitive animals such as sheep grazing pastures fertilised with pig or poultry manure scan (2003a) opinion of the scientific committee for animal nutrition on the use of copper in feedingstuffs secondly inorganic minerals may form insoluble complexes with other dietary agents resulting in low absorption in addition it is thought that the positive charge of many inorganic minerals reduces access to the enterocytes due to repulsion by the negatively charged mucin layer and competition for binding sites
finally the poor retention and high excretion rates of inorganic minerals led to environmental concerns during the 1980s and 1990s especially in europe opinion of the scientific committee for animal nutrition on the use of zinc in feedingstuffs] the european union is concerned about possible detrimental effects of excess supplementation with trace minerals on the environment or human and animal health and so in 2003 legislated a reduction in permitted feed concentrations of several trace metals (co cu fe mn and zn)
research in trace element nutrition has led to the development of more bioavailable organic minerals including trace minerals derived from chelates chelates allow a lower supplementation rate of trace minerals with an equivalent or improved effect on animal health growth and productivity  some samples of natural minerals at the wikimedia commons:
== particular types of chelates ==
they are in summary;
chelates are organic molecules normally consisting of 2 organic parts with an essential trace mineral occupying a central position and held in place by covalent bonding
proteinate are a particular type of chelate in which the mineral is chelated with short-chain peptides and amino acids derived from hydrolysed soy proteins in proteinates minerals are bound to various amino acids with different levels of stability
amino-acid complex such as glycinates or methionates are other particular types of chelate in which the mineral is chelated with an amino acid based on one single type of amino-acid the product is pure (there is only one type of bond or chelation between minerals and the ligand) and it is therefore easier to work on stability and ensure a full chelation moreover depending on the size of amino acid it is also possible to increase the metal content
== research ==
some notice concluded that the utilisation of organic cu from a copper chelate or copper lysine were higher than that of inorganic cu sulfate when fed to rats in the presence and absence of elemental zn or fe the data suggest that unlike inorganic cu organic cu chelates exhibit absorption and excretion mechanisms that do not interfere with fe copper chelate also achieved higher liver zn suggesting less interference at gut absorption sites in comparison with the other forms of cu
effect of organic zinc sources on performance zinc status and carcass meat and claw quality in fattening bulls livestock prod compared a zn chelate a zn polysaccharide complex and zno (inorganic zinc oxide) in bull beef cattle and concluded that the organic forms resulted in some improvement in hoof claw quality
compared the bioavailability of cu and zn chelates in sheep with the inorganic sulfate forms at "low" and "high" supplementation rates copper and zn chelates at the lower rates caused significantly greater increases in blood plasma concentrations than the corresponding treatments with zn sulfate (p<0.05) and cu sulfate (p<0.01) in addition zinc chelate supplementation resulted in significantly greater hoof horn zn content than did zn sulfate (p<0.05) at the "low" supplementation rate zinc chelate achieved better hoof quality than zn sulfate (p<0.05) the data suggest that cu and zn chelates are more readily absorbed and more easily deposited in key tissues such as hooves in comparison with inorganic zn forms
in weaned piglets evaluated various supplementation rates of organic zn in the form of a chelate or as a polysaccharide complex and compared these with zno zinc oxide at 2,000 ppm feeding lower concentrations of organic zn greatly decreased the amount of zn excreted in comparison with inorganic zn without loss of growth performance
studied a copper chelate in weaned pigs in comparison with inorganic cu and sulfate piglet performance was consistently better with organic cu at 50 to 100 ppm in comparison with inorganic cu at 250 ppm in addition organic cu increased cu absorption and retention and decreased cu excretion 77% and 61% respectively compared with 250 ppm inorganic cu
the effects of an mg chelate in broiler chickens in comparison with magnesium oxide and an unsupplemented control group diets for fattening chicken are not normally supplemented with mg but this study indicated positive effects on performance and meat quality during the first 3 weeks of life the mg chelate improved feed efficiency significantly in comparison with both the inorganic mgo and the negative control group (p<0.05) thigh meat ph and oxidative deterioration during storage were also studied the mg chelate increased thigh meat ph in comparison with the negative control (p<0.05) mg supplementation significantly reduced chemical indicators (tbars) of oxidative deterioration in liver and thigh muscle (p<0.01) with mg chelate significantly more efficient than mgo (p<0.01) the data suggest that organic mg in the form of a chelate is capable of reducing oxidation and so improve chicken meat quality
a zn chelate supplement was compared with zn sulfate in broiler chickens.weight gain and feed intake increased quadratically (p<0.05) with increasing zn concentrations from the chelate and linearly with zn sulfate the relative bioavailability of the zn chelate was 183% and 157% of zn sulfate for weight gain and tibia zn respectively the authors concluded that the supplemental concentration of zn required in corn-soy diets for broilers from 121 days of age would be 9.8 mg/kg diet as zn chelate and 20.1 mg/kg diet as zn sulfate,respectively
the effect of replacing inorganic minerals with organic minerals in broiler chickens one group of chickens received inorganic sulfates of cu (12 ppm) fe (45 ppm) mn (70 ppm) and zn (37 ppm) and their performance was compared to a similar group supplemented with chelates of cu (2.5 ppm) fe mn and zn (all at 10 ppm) there were no differences in performance between the birds fed the high inorganic minerals and the birds fed the low organic chelates faecal concentrations of cu fe mn and zn were 55% 73% 46% and 63% respectively of control birds fed inorganic minerals
a broiler study reported also compared inorganic and organic mineral supplementation in broiler chickens control birds were fed cu fe mn se and zn in inorganic forms (15 ppm cu 15 from sulfate; 60 ppm fe from sulfate etc.),and compared with three treatment groups supplemented with organic forms apart from improved feathering most likely associated with the presence of organic se there were no significant performance differences between birds fed inorganic and organic minerals the authors concluded that the use of organic trace minerals permits a reduction of at least 33% in supplement rates in comparison with inorganic minerals without compromising performance
