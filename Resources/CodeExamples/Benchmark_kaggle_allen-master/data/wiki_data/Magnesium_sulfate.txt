magnesium sulfate (or magnesium sulphate) is an inorganic salt (chemical compound) containing magnesium sulfur and oxygen with the formula mgso4 it is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (mgso47h2o) commonly called epsom salt taking its name from a bitter saline spring in epsom in surrey england where the salt was produced from the springs that arise where the porous chalk of the north downs meets non-porous london clay the monohydrate mgso4h2o is found as the mineral kieserite the overall global annual usage in the mid-1970s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons of which the majority was used in agriculture
anhydrous magnesium sulfate is used as a drying agent the anhydrous form is hygroscopic (readily absorbs water from the air) and is therefore difficult to weigh accurately; the hydrate is often preferred when preparing solutions (for example in medical preparations) epsom salt has been traditionally used as a component of bath salts epsom salt can also be used as a beauty product athletes use it to soothe sore muscles while gardeners use it to improve crops it has a variety of other uses epsom salt is also effective in the removal of splinters
it is on the who model list of essential medicines the most important medications needed in a basic health system
== usesedit ==
=== medicaledit ===
magnesium sulfate is a common mineral pharmaceutical preparation of magnesium commonly known as epsom salt used both externally and internally epsom salt is used as bath salts and for isolation tanks oral magnesium sulfate is commonly used as a saline laxative or osmotic purgative magnesium sulfate is the main preparation of intravenous magnesium
internal uses include:
replacement therapy for hypomagnesemia
magnesium sulfate is the first-line antiarrhythmic agent for torsades de pointes in cardiac arrest under the 2005 ecc guidelines and for managing quinidine-induced arrhythmias
as a bronchodilator after beta-agonist and anticholinergic agents have been tried e.g in severe exacerbations of asthma magnesium sulfate can be nebulized to reduce the symptoms of acute asthma it is commonly administered via the intravenous route for the management of severe asthma attacks
magnesium sulfate is effective in decreasing the risk that pre-eclampsia progresses to eclampsia iv magnesium sulfate & diazepam is used to prevent and treat seizures of eclampsia it is also commonly used for eclampsia where compared to diazepam or phenytoin it results in better outcomes
in those who are at risk of a preterm birth a systematic review suggested that intravenous magnesium sulfate before birth could reduce the risk of cerebral palsy and motor dysfunction in preterm infants by 30%
magnesium sulfate has been used as an experimental treatment of irukandji syndrome caused by envenomation by certain species of irukandji jellyfish but the efficacy of this treatment remains unproven
solutions of sulfate salts such as epsom salt may be given as first aid for barium chloride poisoning
the use of epsom salt may help "draw out" splinters
an overdose of magnesium causes hypermagnesemia
=== agricultureedit ===
in gardening and other agriculture magnesium sulfate is used to correct a magnesium or sulfur deficiency in soil; magnesium is an essential element in the chlorophyll molecule and sulfur is another important micronutrient it is most commonly applied to potted plants or to magnesium-hungry crops such as potatoes roses tomatoes lemon trees carrots and peppers the advantage of magnesium sulfate over other magnesium soil amendments (such as dolomitic lime) is its high solubility which also allows the option of foliar feeding solutions of magnesium sulfate are also nearly neutral as compared to alkaline salts of magnesium as found in limestone; therefore the use of magnesium sulfate as a magnesium source for soil does not significantly change the soil ph
=== otheredit ===
anhydrous magnesium sulfate is commonly used as a desiccant in organic synthesis due to its affinity for water during work-up an organic phase is saturated with magnesium sulfate until it no longer forms clumps the hydrated solid is then removed with filtration or decantation other inorganic sulfate salts such as sodium sulfate and calcium sulfate may also be used in the same way
magnesium sulfate is used in bath salts particularly in flotation therapy where high concentrations raise the bath water's specific gravity effectively making the body more buoyant traditionally it is also used to prepare foot baths intended to soothe sore feet the reason for the inclusion of the salt is partially cosmetic: the increase in ionic strength prevents some of the temporary skin wrinkling (partial maceration) which is caused by prolonged immersion of extremities in pure water it is also a common belief that magnesium sulfate can be absorbed into the skin reducing inflammation however no scientific study has ever been published to either explain or reaffirm this belief it is naturally present in some mineral waters
it may also be used as a coagulant for making tofu
magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is also used to maintain the magnesium concentration in marine aquaria which contain large amounts of stony corals as it is slowly depleted in their calcification process in a magnesium-deficient marine aquarium calcium and alkalinity concentrations are very difficult to control because not enough magnesium is present to stabilize these ions in the saltwater and prevent their spontaneous precipitation into calcium carbonate
magnesium sulfate is used as the electrolyte to prepare copper sulfate a magnesium sulfate solution is electrolyzed with a copper anode to form copper sulfate magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen:
cu + mgso4 + 2 h2o h2 + cuso4 + mg(oh)2
magnesium sulfate is used as a brewing salt in beer production to adjust the ion content of the brewing water and enhance enzyme action in the mash or promote a desired flavor profile in the beer
=== pregnancy usageedit ===
magnesium sulfate was once used as a tocolytic but meta-analyses have failed to support it as an anti-contraction medication and its use for prolonged periods (more than five to seven days) may result in health problems for the baby
in those at risk of an early delivery magnesium sulfate appears to decrease the risk of cerebral palsy it is unclear if it helps those who are born at term
=== debateedit ===
a study carried out in february 2015 found that epsom salt minutely raises magnesium levels in those who bathe in it regularly therefore although epsom salts may help relieve some muscle tightness epsom salts are less beneficial than once thought
== physical propertiesedit ==
magnesium sulfate is highly soluble in water the anhydrous form is strongly hygroscopic and can be used as a desiccant it is the primary substance that causes the absorption of sound in seawater (acoustic energy is converted to thermal energy) absorption is strongly dependent on frequency: lower frequencies are less absorbed by the salt so that the sound travels much farther in the ocean boric acid also contributes to absorption but the most abundant salt in seawater sodium chloride has negligible sound absorption
== hydratesedit ==
almost all known mineralogical forms of mgso4 occur as hydrates epsomite is the natural analogue of "epsom salt" another heptahydrate the copper-containing mineral alpersite (mg,cu)so47h2o was recently recognized both are however not the highest known hydrates of mgso4 due to the recent terrestrial find of meridianiite mgso411h2o which is thought to also occur on mars hexahydrite is the next lower (6) hydrate three next lower hydrates pentahydrite (5) starkeyite (4) and especially sanderite (2) are more rarely found kieserite is a monohydrate and is common among evaporitic deposits anhydrous magnesium sulfate was reported from some burning coal dumps but was never treated as a mineral
the ph of hydrates is average 6.0 (5.5 to 6.5) magnesium hydrates have like copper(ii) sulfate coordinated water
== manufacturingedit ==
the heptahydrate can be prepared by neutralizing sulfuric acid with magnesium carbonate or oxide but it is usually obtained directly from natural sources
anhydrous magnesium sulfate is prepared only by the dehydration of a hydrate

magnesium sulfates are common minerals in geological environments their occurrence is mostly connected with supergene processes some of them are also important constituents of evaporitic potassium-magnesium (k-mg) salts deposits
