humgen.org is the website of the centre for genomics and policy which is affiliated with mcgill university and the gnome qubec innovation centre in canada the centre was launched to respond to the urgent need for informed public policy and analyses on socio-ethical issues related to human genetics research at the international national and provincial levels the humgen website provides policy makers and the public access to policy statements concerning genetic research
== mission statement ==
designed with policy makers in mind humgen.org aims to inform professionals and the general public about the ethical legal and social issues raised by human genetics research
its motto is "humgen.org: your resource concerning ethical legal and social issues in human genetics."
== architecture ==
humgen.org is a trilingual web resource available in english french and spanish specializing in the ethical legal and social issues of human genetics it comprises five sections: genbiblio geninfo genedit frequently asked questions and about us
genbiblio is an international database of policy statements from 1990 to the present
geninfo is a bimonthly newsletter offering an overview of current developments including recently adopted policy statements upcoming events and team publications
genedit is an editorial written by a team member and a collaborating international expert that focuses on the ethical legal and social issues surrounding human genetics research
the frequently asked questions section provides lay definitions for issues that arise in the context of human genetics research the information is presented in a format that is easy to navigate and explore it is also designed to allow researchers students and members of the general public alike to become more familiar with relevant policy issues in human genetics
the about us section introduces the members of the humgen team with their photos biographies lists of publications and current research projects
== history ==
=== the centre for genomics and policy ===
the development of the humgen.org website is part of a larger centre for genomics and policy project which was formerly affiliated with the centre de recherche en droit public (crdp) of the universit de montral under the name genetics and society project
the project was launched to respond to the urgent need for informed public policy with the goal of analyzing international regional and national trends in the context of socio-ethical issues in human genetics research
the genetics and society project began its first investigation "ethical evaluation of genomic research," in 1998 and has since completed 33 research projects currently 21 collaborative efforts are underway ranging from maternal-infant research to cardiovascular disease treatment to stem cell therapy the center for genomics and policy recently moved from universit de montrals faculty of law to mcgill universitys faculty of medicine
=== humgen.org ===
faced with rapid advances in human genetics research policy makers continue to struggle with a host of complex ethical legal and social questions the humgen website gives policy makers and the public access to legislation policy guidelines and recommendations from government and nongovernmental organizations worldwide
the website is a unique source of international genetic policy information and has been cited as a critical resource for geneticists who are interested in examining the wider implications of their work
== genbiblio ==
=== definition ===
genbiblio is an international database of legislation policy guidelines and recommendations from 1990 to the present it contains consensus (normative) documents from over 300 governmental and nongovernmental organizations published in english french and spanish it can be searched by jurisdiction organization or keyword for ease of use it is subdivided into four categories: pediagen (pediatrics) stemgen (stem cells) popgen (population genetics) and ipgen (intellectual property)
=== purpose ===
the goal of genbiblio is to provide policy makers from around the globe with up-to-date normative legislation and policies from reputable organizations such as the united nations as well as a reference list of recent (2000 or later) peer-reviewed literature in english french or spanish
