the stressenergy tensor (sometimes stressenergymomentum tensor or energymomentum tensor) is a tensor quantity in physics that describes the density and flux of energy and momentum in spacetime generalizing the stress tensor of newtonian physics it is an attribute of matter radiation and non-gravitational force fields the stressenergy tensor is the source of the gravitational field in the einstein field equations of general relativity just as mass density is the source of such a field in newtonian gravity
== definitionedit ==
the stressenergy tensor involves the use of superscripted variables (not exponents; see tensor index notation and einstein summation notation) if cartesian coordinates in si units are used then the components of the position four-vector are given by: x0 = t x1 = x x2 = y and x3 = z where t is time in seconds and x y and z are distances in meters
the stressenergy tensor is defined as the tensor t of order two that gives the flux of the th component of the momentum vector across a surface with constant x coordinate in the theory of relativity this momentum vector is taken as the four-momentum in general relativity the stressenergy tensor is symmetric
in some alternative theories like einsteincartan theory the stressenergy tensor may not be perfectly symmetric because of a nonzero spin tensor which geometrically corresponds to a nonzero torsion tensor
== identifying the components of the tensoredit ==
because the stressenergy tensor is of order two its components can be displayed in 44 matrix form:
in the following i and k range from 1 through 3
the timetime component is the density of relativistic mass i.e the energy density divided by the speed of light squared it is of special interest because it has a simple physical interpretation in the case of a perfect fluid this component is
and for an electromagnetic field in otherwise empty space this component is
where e and b are the electric and magnetic fields respectively
the flux of relativistic mass across the xi surface is equivalent to the density of the ith component of linear momentum
the components
represent flux of ith component of linear momentum across the xk surface in particular
(not summed) represents normal stress which is called pressure when it is independent of direction the remaining components
represent shear stress (compare with the stress tensor)
in solid state physics and fluid mechanics the stress tensor is defined to be the spatial components of the stressenergy tensor in the proper frame of reference in other words the stress energy tensor in engineering differs from the stressenergy tensor here by a momentum convective term
=== covariant and mixed formsedit ===
in most of this article we work with the contravariant form t of the stressenergy tensor however it is often necessary to work with the covariant form
or the mixed form
or as a mixed tensor density
in this article we use the spacelike sign convention (+++) for the metric signature
== conservation lawedit ==
=== in special relativityedit ===
the stressenergy tensor is the conserved noether current associated with spacetime translations
the divergence of the non-gravitational stressenergy is zero in other words non-gravitational energy and momentum are conserved
when gravity is negligible and using a cartesian coordinate system for spacetime this may be expressed in terms of partial derivatives as
the integral form of this is
where n is any compact four-dimensional region of spacetime; is its boundary a three-dimensional hypersurface; and is an element of the boundary regarded as the outward pointing normal
in flat spacetime and using cartesian coordinates if one combines this with the symmetry of the stressenergy tensor one can show that angular momentum is also conserved:
=== in general relativityedit ===
when gravity is non-negligible or when using arbitrary coordinate systems the divergence of the stressenergy still vanishes but in this case a coordinate free definition of the divergence is used which incorporates the covariant derivative
where is the christoffel symbol which is the gravitational force field
consequently if is any killing vector field then the conservation law associated with the symmetry generated by the killing vector field may be expressed as
the integral form of this is
== in general relativityedit ==
in general relativity the symmetric stressenergy tensor acts as the source of spacetime curvature and is the current density associated with gauge transformations of gravity which are general curvilinear coordinate transformations (if there is torsion then the tensor is no longer symmetric this corresponds to the case with a nonzero spin tensor in einsteincartan gravity theory.)
in general relativity the partial derivatives used in special relativity are replaced by covariant derivatives what this means is that the continuity equation no longer implies that the non-gravitational energy and momentum expressed by the tensor are absolutely conserved i.e the gravitational field can do work on matter and vice versa in the classical limit of newtonian gravity this has a simple interpretation: energy is being exchanged with gravitational potential energy which is not included in the tensor and momentum is being transferred through the field to other bodies in general relativity the landaulifshitz pseudotensor is a unique way to define the gravitational field energy and momentum densities any such stressenergy pseudotensor can be made to vanish locally by a coordinate transformation
in curved spacetime the spacelike integral now depends on the spacelike slice in general there is in fact no way to define a global energymomentum vector in a general curved spacetime
=== the einstein field equationsedit ===
in general relativity the stress tensor is studied in the context of the einstein field equations which are often written as
where is the ricci tensor is the ricci scalar (the tensor contraction of the ricci tensor) the metric tensor and is the universal gravitational constant
== stressenergy in special situationsedit ==
=== isolated particleedit ===
in special relativity the stressenergy of a non-interacting particle with mass m and trajectory is:
where is the velocity vector (which should not be confused with four-velocity)
is the dirac delta function and is the energy of the particle
=== stressenergy of a fluid in equilibriumedit ===
for a perfect fluid in thermodynamic equilibrium the stressenergy tensor takes on a particularly simple form
where is the massenergy density (kilograms per cubic meter) is the hydrostatic pressure (pascals) is the fluid's four velocity and is the reciprocal of the metric tensor
the four velocity satisfies
in an inertial frame of reference comoving with the fluid better known as the fluid's proper frame of reference the four velocity is
the reciprocal of the metric tensor is simply
and the stressenergy tensor is a diagonal matrix
=== electromagnetic stressenergy tensoredit ===
the hilbert stressenergy tensor of a source-free electromagnetic field is
where is the electromagnetic field tensor
=== scalar fieldedit ===
the stressenergy tensor for a scalar field which satisfies the kleingordon equation is
== variant definitions of stressenergyedit ==
there are a number of inequivalent definitions of non-gravitational stressenergy:
=== hilbert stressenergy tensoredit ===
it is defined as a functional derivative
where is the nongravitational part of the lagrangian density of the action this is symmetric and gauge-invariant see einsteinhilbert action for more information
=== canonical stressenergy tensoredit ===
noether's theorem implies that there is a conserved current associated with translations through space and time this is called the canonical stressenergy tensor generally this is not symmetric and if we have some gauge theory it may not be gauge invariant because space-dependent gauge transformations do not commute with spatial translations
in general relativity the translations are with respect to the coordinate system and as such do not transform covariantly see the section below on the gravitational stressenergy pseudo-tensor
=== belinfanterosenfeld stressenergy tensoredit ===
in the presence of spin or other intrinsic angular momentum the canonical noether stress energy tensor fails to be symmetric the belinfanterosenfeld stress energy tensor is constructed from the canonical stressenergy tensor and the spin current in such a way as to be symmetric and still conserved in general relativity this modified tensor agrees with the hilbert stressenergy tensor
== gravitational stressenergyedit ==
by the equivalence principle gravitational stressenergy will always vanish locally at any chosen point in some chosen frame therefore gravitational stressenergy cannot be expressed as a non-zero tensor; instead we have to use a pseudotensor
in general relativity there are many possible distinct definitions of the gravitational stressenergymomentum pseudotensor these include the einstein pseudotensor and the landaulifshitz pseudotensor the landaulifshitz pseudotensor can be reduced to zero at any event in spacetime by choosing an appropriate coordinate system
