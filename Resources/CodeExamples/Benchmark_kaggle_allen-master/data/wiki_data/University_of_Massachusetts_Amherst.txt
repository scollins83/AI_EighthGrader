== history ==
=== foundation and early years ===
the university was founded in 1863 under the provisions of the federal morrill land-grant colleges act to provide instruction to massachusetts citizens in the "agricultural mechanical and military arts." accordingly the university was initially named the massachusetts agricultural college popularly referred to as "mass aggie" or "m.a.c." in 1867 the college had yet to admit any students had been through two presidents and still had not completed any college buildings in that year william s clark was appointed president of the college and professor of botany he quickly appointed a faculty completed the construction plan and in the fall of 1867 admitted the first class of approximately 50 students clark became the first functioning president and arguably the primary founding father of the college
the original buildings consisted of old south college (a dormitory located on the site of the present south college) north college (a second dormitory once located just south of today's machmer hall) the chemistry laboratory also known as college hall (once located on the present site of machmer hall) the boarding house (a small dining hall located just north of the present campus parking garage) the botanic museum (located on the north side of the intersection of stockbridge road and chancellor's hill drive) and the durfee plant house (located on the site of the new durfee conservatory)
although enrollment was slow during the 1870s the fledgling college built momentum under the leadership of president henry hill goodell in the 1880s goodell implemented an expansion plan adding the college drill hall in 1883 (the first gymnasium) the old chapel library in 1885 (one of the oldest extant buildings on campus and an important symbol of the university) and the east and west experiment stations in 1886 and 1890 the campus pond now the central focus of the university campus was created in 1893 by damming a small brook the early 20th century saw great expansion in terms of enrollment and the scope of the curriculum the first female student was admitted in 1875 on a part-time basis and the first full-time female student was admitted in 1892 in 1903 draper hall was constructed for the dual purpose of a dining hall and female housing the first female students graduated with the class of 1905 the first dedicated female dormitory the abigail adams house (on the site of today's lederle tower) was built in 1920
by the start of the 20th century the college was thriving and quickly expanded its curriculum to include the liberal arts in recognition of the higher enrollment and broader curriculum the college was renamed massachusetts state college in 1931
following world war ii the g.i bill facilitating financial aid for veterans led to an explosion of applicants the college population soared and presidents hugh potter baker and ralph van meter labored to push through major construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s particularly with regard to dormitories (now northeast and central residential areas) accordingly the name of the college was changed in 1947 to the "university of massachusetts."

a similar situation had occurred after the patriots lost the super bowl in 2012 officials donning riot gear used smoke grenades to disperse the crowds luckily there were no injuries riots like these are not unheard of within the umass community and go as far back as 1986 the majority of the events are categorized as seemingly peaceful by many students stating that they consist mainly of students standing around chanting and singing there is also still debate among umass students as to whether or not the term riot applies to a lot of the occurrences since they seldom involve violence or aggressive behavior from the vast majority of students present nevertheless each event is met with police interference due to a fear of the unsafe environments that large unattended crowds could create in the past there has been friction between members of the student body and the umass police department around their methods of crowd control; students have been displeased with what they see as unnecessary force
according to masslive other riots include one in 2007 after the boston red sox lost in the 2008 playoffs another when they lost in the world series run in 2006 one after umass football team lost in the division i-aa football championship in 2006 one after the red sox world series victory in 2004 another after the red sox lost during the 2003 playoffs one after the patriots first super bowl victory over st louis in 2001 and another in 1986 after the red sox world series loss the majority of these riots have been non-violent on the side of the students except for the 1986 riot in which an argument between hundreds of students intensified into racial altercations where a black student was attacked by 15-20 white students and beaten unconscious according to archives from the republican videos and visual accounts of most of these events can be found online in the wake of these events students have worked and are continuously working to start open dialogues with the administration and police department about campus safety the right to gather police force and better methods of crowd control

umass amherst issued an announcement in early 2015 stating: "the university has determined that it will no longer admit iranian national students to specific programs in the college of engineering (i.e. chemical engineering electrical & computer engineering mechanical & industrial engineering) and in the college of natural sciences (i.e. physics chemistry microbiology and polymer science & engineering) effective february 1 2015" the university claims that this announcement was posted because a graduate student entered iran for a project and was later denied a visa this along with urging from legal advisers contributed to the belief that such incidents inhibited their ability to give iranian students a "full program of education and research for iranian students" and thus justified changing their admissions policies the ensuing criticism on and off campus as well as wide media publicity changed the minds of school officials as a result umass made a statement on the 18th of february committing to once again allowing iranian students to apply to the aforementioned graduate programs on the same day an official in the u.s foreign ministry stated in an interview that: "u.s laws and regulations do not prevent iranian people from traveling to the united states or studying in engineering program of any u.s academic institutions" umass amherst replaced the ban with a policy aimed at designing specific curricula for admitted iranian nationals based on their needs while less controversial this has still generated backlash with one student saying "this university thats supposed to be so open-minded forcing him to sign a document saying he wont go home and build a bomb or something is just really disappointing to see."
