== history ==
ancona was founded by greek settlers from syracuse about 387 bc who gave it its name: ancona stems from the greek word  meaning "elbow"; the harbour to the east of the town was originally protected only by the promontory on the north shaped like an elbow greek merchants established a tyrian purple dye factory here in roman times it kept its own coinage with the punning device of the bent arm holding a palm branch and the head of aphrodite on the reverse and continued the use of the greek language
when it became a roman colony is uncertain it was occupied as a naval station in the illyrian war of 178 bc julius caesar took possession of it immediately after crossing the rubicon its harbour was of considerable importance in imperial times as the nearest to dalmatia and was enlarged by trajan who constructed the north quay with his syrian architect apollodorus of damascus at the beginning of it stands the marble triumphal arch with a single archway and without bas-reliefs erected in his honour in 115 by the senate and roman people
ancona was successively attacked by the goths lombards and saracens between the 3rd and 5th centuries but recovered its strength and importance it was one of the cities of the pentapolis of the roman exarchate of ravenna in the 7th and 8th centuries in 840 saracen raiders sacked and burned the city after charlesmagne's conquest of northern italy it became the capital of the marca di ancona whence the name of the modern region after 1000 ancona became increasingly independent eventually turning into an important maritime republic (together with gaeta trani and ragusa it is one of those not appearing on the italian naval flag) often clashing against the nearby power of venice an oligarchic republic ancona was ruled by six elders elected by the three terzieri into which the city was divided: s pietro porto and capodimonte it had a coin of its own the agontano and a series of laws known as statuti del mare e del terzenale and statuti della dogana ancona was usually allied with ragusa and the byzantine empire in 1137 1167 and 1174 it was strong enough to push back the forces of the holy roman empire anconitan ships took part in the crusades and their navigators included cyriac of ancona in the struggle between the popes and the holy roman emperors that troubled italy from the 12th century onwards ancona sided with the guelphs
differently from other cities of northern italy ancona never became a seignory the sole exception was the rule of the malatesta who took the city in 1348 taking advantage of the black death and of a fire that had destroyed many of its important buildings the malatesta were ousted in 1383 in 1532 it definitively lost its freedom and became part of the papal states under pope clement vii symbol of the papal authority was the massive citadel together with rome and avignon in southern france ancona was the sole city in the papal states in which the jews were allowed to stay after 1569 living in the ghetto built after 1555
in 1733 pope clement xii extended the quay and an inferior imitation of trajan's arch was set up; he also erected a lazaretto at the south end of the harbour luigi vanvitelli being the architect-in-chief the southern quay was built in 1880 and the harbour was protected by forts on the heights from 1797 onwards when the french took it it frequently appears in history as an important fortress ancona entered the kingdom of italy when christophe lon louis juchault de lamoricire surrendered here on 29 september 1860 eleven days after his defeat at castelfidardo
on 23 may 1915 italy entered world war i and joined the entente powers; in response the austro-hungarian navy attacked ancona causing extensive damage and killing several dozen people
during world war ii in july 1944 the city was taken by the polish ii corps as part of an allied operation to gain access to a seaport closer to the gothic line in order to shorten their lines of communication for the advance into northern italy
=== the greek community of ancona in the 16th century ===
ancona as well as venice became a very important destination for merchants from the ottoman empire during the 16th century the greeks formed the largest of the communities of foreign merchants they were refugees from former byzantine or venetian territories that were occupied by the ottomans in the late 15th and 16th centuries the first greek community was established in ancona early in the 16th century natalucci the 17th-century historian of the city notes the existence of 200 greek families in ancona at the opening of the 16th century most of them came from northwestern greece i.e the ionian islands and epirus in 1514 dimitri caloiri of ioannina obtained reduced custom duties for greek merchants coming from the towns of ioannina arta and avlona in epirus in 1518 a jewish merchant of avlona succeeded in lowering the duties paid in ancona for all the levantine merchants subjects to the turk
in 1531 the confraternity of the greeks (confraternita dei greci) was established which included orthodox and catholic greeks they secured the use of the church of st anna dei greci and were granted permission to hold services according to the greek and the latin rite the church of st anna had existed since the 13th century initially as "santa maria in porta cipriana," on ruins of the ancient greek walls of ancona
in 1534 a decision by pope paul iii favoured the activity of merchants of all nationalities and religions from the levant and allowed them to settle in ancona with their families a venetian travelling through ancona in 1535 recorded that the city was "full of merchants from every nation and mostly greeks and turks." in the second half of the 16th century the presence of greek and other merchants from the ottoman empire declined after a series of restrictive measures taken by the italian authorities and the pope
disputes between the orthodox and catholic greeks of the community were frequent and persisted until 1797 when the city was occupied by france who closed all the religious confraternities and confiscated the archive of the greek community the church of st anna dei greci was re-opened to services in 1822 in 1835 in the absence of a greek community in ancona it passed to the latin church
