in chemistry ph (/piet/) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution it is roughly the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the concentration measured in units of moles per liter of hydrogen ions or h+ more precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion solutions with a ph less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a ph greater than 7 are basic pure water is neutral being neither an acid nor a base contrary to popular belief the ph value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively
ph measurements are important in medicine biology chemistry agriculture forestry food science environmental science oceanography civil engineering chemical engineering nutrition water treatment & water purification and many other applications
the ph scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose ph is established by international agreement primary ph standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode the ph of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a ph meter or indicator
ph is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the (solvated) hydronium ion more often (albeit somewhat inaccurately) expressed as the measure of the hydronium ion concentration
== history ==
the concept of p[h] was first introduced by danish chemist sren peder lauritz srensen at the carlsberg laboratory in 1909 and revised to the modern ph in 1924 to accommodate definitions and measurements in terms of electrochemical cells in the first papers the notation had the "h" as a subscript to the lowercase "p" as so: ph
the exact meaning of the "p" in "ph" is disputed but according to the carlsberg foundation ph stands for "power of hydrogen" it has also been suggested that the "p" stands for the german potenz (meaning "power") others refer to french puissance (also meaning "power" based on the fact that the carlsberg laboratory was french-speaking) another suggestion is that the "p" stands for the latin terms pondus hydrogenii (engl quantity of hydrogen) potentia hydrogenii (engl capacity of hydrogen) or potential hydrogen it is also suggested that srensen used the letters "p" and "q" (commonly paired letters in mathematics) simply to label the test solution (p) and the reference solution (q) current use in chemistry is that p stands for "decimal cologarithm of" as also in the term pka used for acid dissociation constants
== definition and measurement ==
=== ph ===
ph is defined as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion activity ah+ in a solution
this definition was adopted because ion-selective electrodes which are used to measure ph respond to activity ideally electrode potential e follows the nernst equation which for the hydrogen ion can be written as
where e is a measured potential e0 is the standard electrode potential r is the gas constant t is the temperature in kelvin f is the faraday constant for h+ number of electrons transferred is one it follows that electrode potential is proportional to ph when ph is defined in terms of activity precise measurement of ph is presented in international standard iso 31-8 as follows: a galvanic cell is set up to measure the electromotive force (e.m.f.) between a reference electrode and an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed in the same aqueous solution the reference electrode may be a silver chloride electrode or a calomel electrode the hydrogen-ion selective electrode is a standard hydrogen electrode
reference electrode | concentrated solution of kcl || test solution | h2 | pt
firstly the cell is filled with a solution of known hydrogen ion activity and the emf es is measured then the emf ex of the same cell containing the solution of unknown ph is measured
the difference between the two measured emf values is proportional to ph this method of calibration avoids the need to know the standard electrode potential the proportionality constant 1/z is ideally equal to the "nernstian slope"
to apply this process in practice a glass electrode is used rather than the cumbersome hydrogen electrode a combined glass electrode has an in-built reference electrode it is calibrated against buffer solutions of known hydrogen ion activity iupac has proposed the use of a set of buffer solutions of known h+ activity two or more buffer solutions are used in order to accommodate the fact that the "slope" may differ slightly from ideal to implement this approach to calibration the electrode is first immersed in a standard solution and the reading on a ph meter is adjusted to be equal to the standard buffer's value the reading from a second standard buffer solution is then adjusted using the "slope" control to be equal to the ph for that solution further details are given in the iupac recommendations when more than two buffer solutions are used the electrode is calibrated by fitting observed ph values to a straight line with respect to standard buffer values commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information on the value at 25 c and a correction factor to be applied for other temperatures
the ph scale is logarithmic and therefore ph is a dimensionless quantity
=== p[h] ===
this was the original definition of srensen which was superseded in favor of ph in 1924 however it is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations one way to do this which has been used extensively is to titrate a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong alkaline in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte since the concentrations of acid and alkaline are known it is easy to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations the calibration is usually carried out using a gran plot the calibration yields a value for the standard electrode potential e0 and a slope factor f so that the nernst equation in the form
can be used to derive hydrogen ion concentrations from experimental measurements of e the slope factor f is usually slightly less than one a slope factor of less than 0.95 indicates that the electrode is not functioning correctly the presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient is effectively constant during the titration as it is constant its value can be set to one by defining the standard state as being the solution containing the background electrolyte thus the effect of using this procedure is to make activity equal to the numerical value of concentration
the glass electrode (and other ion selective electrodes) should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated for instance if one wishes to measure the ph of a seawater sample the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition as detailed below
the difference between p[h] and ph is quite small it has been stated that ph = p[h] + 0.04 it is common practice to use the term "ph" for both types of measurement
=== ph indicators ===
indicators may be used to measure ph by making use of the fact that their color changes with ph visual comparison of the color of a test solution with a standard color chart provides a means to measure ph accurate to the nearest whole number more precise measurements are possible if the color is measured spectrophotometrically using a colorimeter of spectrophotometer universal indicator consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous color change from about ph 2 to ph 10 universal indicator paper is made from absorbent paper that has been impregnated with universal indicator
=== poh ===
poh is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions oh or alkalinity poh values are derived from ph measurements the concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by
where kw is the self-ionisation constant of water taking logarithms
so at room temperature poh 14 ph however this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances such as in measurements of soil alkalinity
=== extremes of ph ===
measurement of ph below about 2.5 (ca 0.003 mol dm3 acid) and above about 10.5 (ca 0.0003 mol dm3 alkaline) requires special procedures because when using the glass electrode the nernst law breaks down under those conditions various factors contribute to this it cannot be assumed that liquid junction potentials are independent of ph also extreme ph implies that the solution is concentrated so electrode potentials are affected by ionic strength variation at high ph the glass electrode may be affected by "alkaline error" because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations such as na+ and k+ in the solution specially constructed electrodes are available which partly overcome these problems
runoff from mines or mine tailings can produce some very low ph values
=== non-aqueous solutions ===
hydrogen ion concentrations (activities) can be measured in non-aqueous solvents ph values based on these measurements belong to a different scale from aqueous ph values because activities relate to different standard states hydrogen ion activity ah+ can be defined as:
where h+ is the chemical potential of the hydrogen ion oh+ is its chemical potential in the chosen standard state r is the gas constant and t is the thermodynamic temperature therefore ph values on the different scales cannot be compared directly requiring an intersolvent scale which involves the transfer activity coefficient of hydrolyonium ion
ph is an example of an acidity function other acidity functions can be defined for example the hammett acidity function h0 has been developed in connection with superacids
the concept of "unified ph scale" has been developed on the basis of the absolute chemical potential of the proton this scale applies to liquids gases and even solids
== applications ==
pure water is neutral when an acid is dissolved in water the ph will be less than 7 when a base or alkaline is dissolved in water the ph will be greater than 7 a solution of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid at concentration 1 mol dm3 has a ph of 0 a solution of a strong alkaline such as sodium hydroxide at concentration 1 mol dm3 has a ph of 14 thus measured ph values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14 though negative ph values and values above 14 are entirely possible since ph is a logarithmic scale a difference of one ph unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration the ph of an aqueous solution of a salt such as sodium chloride is slightly different from that of a neutral solution even though the salt is neither acidic nor basic this is because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on ionic strength so kw varies with ionic strength
if pure water is exposed to air it becomes mildly acidic this is because water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air which is then slowly converted into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions (essentially creating carbonic acid)
=== ph in nature ===
ph-dependent plant pigments that can be used as ph indicators occur in many plants including hibiscus red cabbage (anthocyanin) and red wine the juice of citrus fruits is acidic mainly because it contains citric acid other carboxylic acids occur in many living systems for example lactic acid is produced by muscle activity the state of protonation of phosphate derivatives such as atp is ph-dependent the functioning of the oxygen-transport enzyme hemoglobin is affected by ph in a process known as the root effect
=== seawater ===
the ph of seawater plays an important role in the ocean's carbon cycle and there is evidence of ongoing ocean acidification caused by carbon dioxide emissions however ph measurement is complicated by the chemical properties of seawater and several distinct ph scales exist in chemical oceanography
as part of its operational definition of the ph scale the iupac defines a series of buffer solutions across a range of ph values (often denoted with nbs or nist designation) these solutions have a relatively low ionic strength (~0.1) compared to that of seawater (~0.7) and as a consequence are not recommended for use in characterizing the ph of seawater since the ionic strength differences cause changes in electrode potential to resolve this problem an alternative series of buffers based on artificial seawater was developed this new series resolves the problem of ionic strength differences between samples and the buffers and the new ph scale is referred to as the 'total scale' often denoted as pht the total scale was defined using a medium containing sulfate ions these ions experience protonation h+ + so42 hso4 such that the total scale includes the effect of both protons (free hydrogen ions) and hydrogen sulfate ions:
[h+]t = [h+]f + [hso4]
an alternative scale the 'free scale' often denoted 'phf' omits this consideration and focuses solely on [h+]f in principle making it a simpler representation of hydrogen ion concentration only [h+]t can be determined therefore [h+]f must be estimated using the [so42] and the stability constant of hso4 ks*:
[h+]f = [h+]t [hso4] = [h+]t ( 1 + [so42] / ks* )1
however it is difficult to estimate ks* in seawater limiting the utility of the otherwise more straightforward free scale
another scale known as the 'seawater scale' often denoted 'phsws' takes account of a further protonation relationship between hydrogen ions and fluoride ions h+ + f hf resulting in the following expression for [h+]sws:
[h+]sws = [h+]f + [hso4] + [hf]
however the advantage of considering this additional complexity is dependent upon the abundance of fluoride in the medium in seawater for instance sulfate ions occur at much greater concentrations (>400 times) than those of fluoride as a consequence for most practical purposes the difference between the total and seawater scales is very small
the following three equations summarise the three scales of ph:
phf = log [h+]f
pht = log ( [h+]f + [hso4] ) = log [h+]t
phsws = log ( [h+]f + [hso4] + [hf] ) = log [h+]sws
in practical terms the three seawater ph scales differ in their values by up to 0.12 ph units differences that are much larger than the accuracy of ph measurements typically required in particular in relation to the ocean's carbonate system since it omits consideration of sulfate and fluoride ions the free scale is significantly different from both the total and seawater scales because of the relative unimportance of the fluoride ion the total and seawater scales differ only very slightly
=== living systems ===
the ph of different cellular compartments body fluids and organs is usually tightly regulated in a process called acid-base homeostasis the most common disorder in acid-base homeostasis is acidosis which means an acid overload in the body generally defined by ph falling below 7.35 alkalosis is the opposite condition with blood ph being excessively high
the ph of blood is usually slightly basic with a value of ph 7.365 this value is often referred to as physiological ph in biology and medicine plaque can create a local acidic environment that can result in tooth decay by demineralization enzymes and other proteins have an optimum ph range and can become inactivated or denatured outside this range
== calculations of ph ==
the calculation of the ph of a solution containing acids and/or bases is an example of a chemical speciation calculation that is a mathematical procedure for calculating the concentrations of all chemical species that are present in the solution the complexity of the procedure depends on the nature of the solution for strong acids and bases no calculations are necessary except in extreme situations the ph of a solution containing a weak acid requires the solution of a quadratic equation the ph of a solution containing a weak base may require the solution of a cubic equation the general case requires the solution of a set of non-linear simultaneous equations
a complicating factor is that water itself is a weak acid and a weak base (see amphoterism) it dissociates according to the equilibrium
with a dissociation constant kw defined as
where [h+] stands for the concentration of the aqueous hydronium ion and [oh] represents the concentration of the hydroxide ion this equilibrium needs to be taken into account at high ph and when the solute concentration is extremely low
=== strong acids and bases ===
strong acids and bases are compounds that for practical purposes are completely dissociated in water under normal circumstances this means that the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic solution can be taken to be equal to the concentration of the acid the ph is then equal to minus the logarithm of the concentration value hydrochloric acid (hcl) is an example of a strong acid the ph of a 0.01m solution of hcl is equal to log10(0.01) that is ph = 2 sodium hydroxide naoh is an example of a strong base the p[oh] value of a 0.01m solution of naoh is equal to log10(0.01) that is p[oh] = 2 from the definition of p[oh] above this means that the ph is equal to about 12 for solutions of sodium hydroxide at higher concentrations the self-ionization equilibrium must be taken into account
self-ionization must also be considered when concentrations are extremely low consider for example a solution of hydrochloric acid at a concentration of 5108m the simple procedure given above would suggest that it has a ph of 7.3 this is clearly wrong as an acid solution should have a ph of less than 7 treating the system as a mixture of hydrochloric acid and the amphoteric substance water a ph of 6.89 results
=== weak acids and bases ===
a weak acid or the conjugate acid of a weak base can be treated using the same formalism
acid:
base:
first an acid dissociation constant is defined as follows electrical charges are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake of generality
and its value is assumed to have been determined by experiment this being so there are three unknown concentrations [ha] [h+] and [a] to determine by calculation two additional equations are needed one way to provide them is to apply the law of mass conservation in terms of the two "reagents" h and a
c stands for analytical concentration in some texts one mass balance equation is replaced by an equation of charge balance this is satisfactory for simple cases like this one but is more difficult to apply to more complicated cases as those below together with the equation defining ka there are now three equations in three unknowns when an acid is dissolved in water ca = ch = ca the concentration of the acid so [a] = [h] after some further algebraic manipulation an equation in the hydrogen ion concentration may be obtained
solution of this quadratic equation gives the hydrogen ion concentration and hence p[h] or more loosely ph this procedure is illustrated in an ice table which can also be used to calculate the ph when some additional (strong) acid or alkaline has been added to the system that is when ca ch
for example what is the ph of a 0.01m solution of benzoic acid pka = 4.19
step 1:
step 2: set up the quadratic equation
step 3: solve the quadratic equation ; ph = 3.11
for alkaline solutions an additional term is added to the mass-balance equation for hydrogen since addition of hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration is constrained by the self-ionization equilibrium to be equal to
in this case the resulting equation in [h] is a cubic equation
=== general method ===
some systems such as with polyprotic acids are amenable to spreadsheet calculations with three or more reagents or when many complexes are formed with general formulae such as apbqhr the following general method can be used to calculate the ph of a solution for example with three reagents each equilibrium is characterized by and equilibrium constant 
next write down the mass-balance equations for each reagent:
note that there are no approximations involved in these equations except that each stability constant is defined as a quotient of concentrations not activities much more complicated expressions are required if activities are to be used
there are 3 non-linear simultaneous equations in the three unknowns [a] [b] and [h] because the equations are non-linear and because concentrations may range over many powers of 10 the solution of these equations is not straightforward however many computer programs are available which can be used to perform these calculations there may be more than three reagents the calculation of hydrogen ion concentrations using this formalism is a key element in the determination of equilibrium constants by potentiometric titration
