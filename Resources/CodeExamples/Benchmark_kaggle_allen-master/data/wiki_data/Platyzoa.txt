the platyzoa /pltzo./ are a group of protostome animals proposed by thomas cavalier-smith in 1998 cavalier-smith included in platyzoa the phylum platyhelminthes or flatworms and a new phylum acanthognatha into which he gathered several previously described phyla of microscopic animals subsequent studies have supported platyzoa as a clade a monophyletic group of organisms with a common ancestor while differing on the phyla included and on relationships within platyzoa
== phyla ==
one current scheme places the following traditional phyla in platyzoa:
platyhelminthes
gastrotricha
gnathifera
rotifera
acanthocephala
gnathostomulida
micrognathozoa
cycliophora
== characteristics ==
none of the platyzoa groups have a respiration or circulation system because of their small size flat body or parasitic lifestyle the platyhelminthes and gastrotricha are acoelomate the other phyla have a pseudocoel and share characteristics such as the structure of their jaws and pharynx although these have been secondarily lost in the parasitic acanthocephala they form a monophyletic subgroup called the gnathifera
the name "platyzoa" is used because most members are flat though rotifers are not
== classification ==
the platyzoa are close relatives of the lophotrochozoa and are sometimes included in that group together the two make up the spiralia
