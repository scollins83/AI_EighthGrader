maribavir is an oral antiviral drug candidate licensed from glaxosmithkline in 2003 for the prevention and treatment of human cytomegalovirus disease in hematopoietic stem cell/bone marrow transplant patients in february 2006 viropharma announced that the united states food and drug administration (fda) had granted the company fast track status for maribavir
in march 2006 the company announced that a phase ii study with maribavir demonstrated that prophylaxis with maribavir displays strong antiviral activity as measured by statistically significant reduction in the rate of reactivation of cmv in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell/bone marrow transplants in an intent-to-treat analysis of the first 100 days after the transplant the number of subjects who required pre-emptive anti-cmv therapy was statistically significantly reduced (p-value = 0.051 to 0.001) in each of the maribavir groups compared to the placebo group (57% for placebo vs 15% 30% and 15% for maribavir 100 mg twice daily 400 mg daily and 400 mg twice daily respectively)
viropharma conducted a phase iii clinical study to evaluate the prophylactic use for the prevention of cytomegalovirus disease in recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplant patients in february 2009 viropharma announced that the phase iii study failed to achieve its goal showing no significant difference between maribavir and a placebo in reducing the rate of cmv disease

oral pleconaril was viropharma's first compound licensed from sanofi in 1995 pleconaril is active against viruses in the picornavirus family viropharma's first indication was for enteroviral meningitis but that indication was abandoned when the clinical trials did not demonstrate efficacy
in 2001 viropharma submitted a new drug application of pleconaril to the fda for the common cold on 2002-03-19 the fda antiviral advisory committee recommended that the company had failed to show adequate safety and the fda subsequently issued a not-approvable letter
in november 2003 viropharma licensed pleconaril to schering-plough who are developing an intranasal formulation for the common cold and asthma exacerbations (schering-plough development pipeline) in august 2006 schering-plough started a phase ii clinical trial
