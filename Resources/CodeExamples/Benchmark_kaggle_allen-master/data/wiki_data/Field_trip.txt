a field trip or excursion is a journey by a group of people to a place away from their normal environment when done for students it is also known as school trip in the uk new zealand philippines; and school tour in ireland
the purpose of the trip is usually observation for education non-experimental research or to provide students with experiences outside their everyday activities such as going camping with teachers and their classmates the aim of this research is to observe the subject in its natural state and possibly collect samples field trips are also used to produce civilized young men and women who appreciate culture and the arts it is seen that more-advantaged children may have already experienced cultural institutions outside of school and field trips provide a common ground with more-advantaged and less-advantaged children to have some of the same cultural experiences in the arts
field trips are most often done in 3 steps: preparation activities and follow-up activity preparation applies to both the student and the teacher teachers often take the time to learn about the destination and the subject before the trip activities that happen on the field trips often include: lectures tours worksheets videos and demonstrations follow-up activities are generally discussions that occur in the classroom once the field trip is completed
