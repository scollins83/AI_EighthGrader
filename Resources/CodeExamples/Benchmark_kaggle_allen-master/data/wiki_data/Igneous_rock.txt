igneous rock (derived from the latin word ignis meaning fire) is one of the three main rock types the others being sedimentary and metamorphic igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava igneous rock may form with or without crystallization either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks this magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust typically the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature a decrease in pressure or a change in composition over 700 types of igneous rocks have been described most of them having formed beneath the surface of earth's crust
== geological significanceedit ==
igneous and metamorphic rocks make up 9095% of the top 16 km of the earth's crust by volume
igneous rocks are geologically important because:
their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle from which some igneous rocks are extracted and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction and/or of other pre-existing rock that melted;
their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata allowing a time sequence of events;
their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment allowing tectonic reconstitutions (see plate tectonics);
in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits (ores): for example tungsten tin and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros
== morphology and settingedit ==
in terms of modes of occurrence igneous rocks can be either intrusive (plutonic) extrusive (volcanic) or hypabyssal
=== intrusiveedit ===
intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and as a result these rocks are coarse grained the mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes typical intrusive formations are batholiths stocks laccoliths sills and dikes when the magma solidifies within the earth's crust it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks such as granite gabbro or diorite
the central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks usually granite when exposed by erosion these cores (called batholiths) may occupy huge areas of the earth's surface
coarse grained intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed as abyssal; intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed hypabyssal
=== extrusiveedit ===
extrusive igneous rocks also known as volcanic rocks are formed at the crust's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks they are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface the magma which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions solidifies at a faster rate hence such rocks are smooth crystalline and fine grained basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows lava sheets and lava plateaus some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns the giant's causeway found in antrim northern ireland is an example
the molten rock with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles is called magma it rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created when magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air it is called lava eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine black smokers and mid-ocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity
the volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions:
divergent boundary: 73%
convergent boundary (subduction zone): 15%
hotspot: 12%
magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity determined by temperature composition and crystal content high-temperature magma most of which is basaltic in composition behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and as it cools treacle long thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common intermediate composition magma such as andesite tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash tuff and lava and may have a viscosity similar to thick cold molasses or even rubber when erupted felsic magma such as rhyolite is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins because the magma is so viscous
felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gasestypically water vapour but also carbon dioxide explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff agglomerate and ignimbrite fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits which can often cover vast areas
because lava cools and crystallizes rapidly it is fine grained if the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion the resulting rock may be mostly glass (such as the rock obsidian) if the cooling of the lava happened more slowly the rocks would be coarse-grained
because the minerals are mostly fine-grained it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks generally the mineral constituents of fine-grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field
=== hypabyssaledit ===
hypabyssal igneous rocks are formed at a depth in between the plutonic and volcanic rocks these are formed due to cooling and resultant solidification of rising magma just beneath the earth surface hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes sills laccoliths lopoliths or phacoliths
== classificationedit ==
igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence texture mineralogy chemical composition and the geometry of the igneous body
the classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size which largely depends on the cooling history and the mineral composition of the rock feldspars quartz or feldspathoids olivines pyroxenes amphiboles and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks and they are basic to the classification of these rocks all other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates
in a simplified classification igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present the presence or absence of quartz and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz the type of iron or magnesium minerals present rocks containing quartz (silica in composition) are silica-oversaturated rocks with feldspathoids are silica-undersaturated because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz
igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic generally speaking phaneritic implies an intrusive origin; aphanitic an extrusive one
an igneous rock with larger clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained uniform material
igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition texture refers to the size shape and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed
=== textureedit ===
texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks the texture of volcanic rocks including the size shape orientation and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava
however the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely fine-grained groundmass or from airfall tuffs which may be formed from volcanic ash
textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens magnifying glass or microscope plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses) mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks with phenocryst species used as a prefix e.g "olivine-bearing picrite" or "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite"

=== chemical classification and petrologyedit ===
igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters
chemical: total alkali-silica content (tas diagram) for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable:
felsic igneous rocks containing a high silica content greater than 63% sio2 (examples granite and rhyolite)
intermediate igneous rocks containing between 52 63% sio2 (example andesite and dacite)
mafic igneous rocks have low silica 45 52% and typically high iron magnesium content (example gabbro and basalt)
ultramafic rock igneous rocks with less than 45% silica (examples picrite komatiite and peridotite)
alkalic igneous rocks with 5 15% alkali (k2o + na2o) content or with a molar ratio of alkali to silica greater than 1:6 (examples phonolite and trachyte)
chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the tas diagram for instance;
ultrapotassic; rocks containing molar k2o/na2o >3
peralkaline; rocks containing molar (k2o + na2o)/ al2o3 >1
peraluminous; rocks containing molar (k2o + na2o)/ al2o3 <1
an idealized mineralogy (the normative mineralogy) can be calculated from the chemical composition and the calculation is useful for rocks too fine-grained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt for instance normative quartz classifies a rock as silica-oversaturated; an example is rhyolite in an older terminology silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the sio2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic a normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite
=== history of classificationedit ===
in 1902 a group of american petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a "quantitative" classification based on chemical analysis they showed how vague and often unscientific much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic it should be elevated to prime position
geological occurrence structure mineralogical constitutionthe hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock specieswere relegated to the background the completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes e.g. quartz feldspars olivine akermannite feldspathoids magnetite corundum and so on and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another
== mineralogical classificationedit ==
for volcanic rocks mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas the most important criterion is the phenocryst species followed by the groundmass mineralogy often where the groundmass is aphanitic chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock
mineralogic contents felsic versus mafic
felsic rock highest content of silicon with predominance of quartz alkali feldspar and/or feldspathoids: the felsic minerals; these rocks (e.g. granite rhyolite) are usually light coloured and have low density
mafic rock lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes olivines and calcic plagioclase; these rocks (example basalt gabbro) are usually dark coloured and have a higher density than felsic rocks
ultramafic rock lowest content of silicon with more than 90% of mafic minerals (e.g. dunite)
for intrusive plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks (where all minerals are visible at least via microscope) the mineralogy is used to classify the rock this usually occurs on ternary diagrams where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock
the following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence
for a more detailed classification see qapf diagram
=== example of classificationedit ===
granite is an igneous intrusive rock (crystallized at depth) with felsic composition (rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassium-rich feldspar plus sodium-rich plagioclase) and phaneritic subeuhedral texture (minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes)
== magma originationedit ==
the earth's crust averages about 35 kilometers thick under the continents but averages only some 710 kilometers beneath the oceans the continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks including granulite and granite oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle
rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure to a change in composition (such as an addition of water) to an increase in temperature or to a combination of these processes
other mechanisms such as melting from a meteorite impact are less important today but impacts during the accretion of the earth led to extensive melting and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early earth was probably an ocean of magma impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces
=== decompressionedit ===
decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure
the solidus temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water peridotite at depth in the earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level if such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process but the cooling is only about 0.3 c per kilometer experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3 c to 4 c per kilometer if the rock rises far enough it will begin to melt melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards this process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the earth
decompression melting creates the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges it also causes volcanism in intraplate regions such as europe africa and the pacific sea floor there it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes (the "plume hypothesis") or to intraplate extension (the "plate hypothesis")
=== effects of water and carbon dioxideedit ===
the change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure for example at a depth of about 100 kilometers peridotite begins to melt near 800 c in the presence of excess water but near or above about 1,500 c in the absence of water water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones and it causes melting in the overlying mantle hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process such magmas and those derived from them build up island arcs such as those in the pacific ring of fire these magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series an important part of the continental crust
the addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions in the presence of carbon dioxide experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about 200 c in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70 km at greater depths carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200 km the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450 c to 600 c lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide magmas of rock types such as nephelinite carbonatite and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70 km
=== temperature increaseedit ===
increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary the plate boundary between the indian and asian continental masses provides a well-studied example as the tibetan plateau just north of the boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the tibetan plateau granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone
=== magma evolutionedit ===
most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories more typically they are mixes of melt and crystals and sometimes also of gas bubbles melt crystals and bubbles usually have different densities and so they can separate as magmas evolve
as magma cools minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization) as minerals crystallize the composition of the residual melt typically changes if crystals separate from the melt then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma for instance a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200 c and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700 c incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma
magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization for instance magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them magmas of different compositions can mix with one another in rare cases melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions
there are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon oxygen aluminium sodium potassium calcium iron and magnesium these are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks the chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g. 51% sio2 and 1.50% tio2) abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g. 420 ppm ni and 5.1 ppm sm) the term "trace element" is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm the diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical dataover 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the u s national science foundation (see the external link to earthchem)
