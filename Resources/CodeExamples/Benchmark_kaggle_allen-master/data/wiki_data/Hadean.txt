prebiotic world redirects here but there is as yet no subdivision of this eon to reflect recent developments
the hadean /hedin/ is a geologic eon of the earth and lies before the archean it began with the formation of the earth about 4.6 billion years ago and ended as defined by the ics 4 billion years ago the name "hadean" comes from hades the ancient greek god of the underworld in reference to the hellish conditions on earth at the time: the planet had just formed and was still very hot due to high volcanism a partially molten surface and frequent collisions with other solar system bodies the geologist preston cloud coined the term in 1972 originally to label the period before the earliest-known rocks on earth w brian harland later coined an almost synonymous term: the "priscoan period" other older texts simply refer to the eon as the pre-archean nonetheless in 2015 "remains of biotic life" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia according to one of the researchers "if life arose relatively quickly on earth  then it could be common in the universe."
== etymologyedit ==
the hadean was a violent period in the history of earth hence it receives its name from hades (/hediz/; from ancient greek / hids; doric aidas) the ancient greek god of the underworld

since few geological traces of this eon remain on earth there is no official subdivision however the lunar geologic timescale embraces several major divisions relating to the hadean and so these are sometimes used in a somewhat informal sense to refer to the same periods of time on earth
the lunar divisions are:
pre-nectarian from the formation of the moon's crust up to about 3,920 million years ago
nectarian ranging up to about 3,850 million years ago in a time when the late heavy bombardment according to that theory was in a stage of decline
there is a recently proposed alternative scale that includes the addition of the chaotian and prenephelean eons preceding the hadean and divides the hadean into three eras with two periods each the paleohadean era consists of the hephaestean (4.5-4.4 ga) and the jacobian periods (4.4-4.3 ga) the mesohadean is divided into the canadian (4.3-4.2 ga) and the procrustean periods (4.2-4.1 ga) the neohadean is divided into the acastan (4.1-4.0 ga) and the promethean periods (4.0-3.9 ga)

in the last decades of the 20th century geologists identified a few hadean rocks from western greenland northwestern canada and western australia
the oldest dated zircon crystals enclosed in a metamorphosed sandstone conglomerate in the jack hills of the narryer gneiss terrane of western australia date to 4.404 0.008 ga this zircon is a slight outlier with the oldest consistently-dated zircon falling closer to 4.35 gaaround 200 million years after the hypothesized time of the earth's formation

a sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed the earth water molecules would have escaped earth's gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation hydrogen and helium are expected to continually escape (even to the present day) due to atmospheric escape
part of the ancient planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the impact that created the moon which should have caused melting of one or two large areas present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to completely melt and mix huge rock masses however a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact creating a rock vapor atmosphere around the young planet the rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy co
2 atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of 230 c (446 f) because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy co
2 atmosphere as cooling continued subduction and dissolving in ocean water removed most co
2 from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared
study of zircons has found that liquid water must have existed as long ago as 4,400 million years ago very soon after the formation of the earth this requires the presence of an atmosphere the cool early earth theory covers a range from about 4,400 to 4,000 million years ago
a september 2008 study of zircons found that australian hadean rock holds minerals that point to the existence of plate tectonics as early as 4,000 million years ago if this is true the time when earth finished its transition from having a hot molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide to being very much like it is today can be roughly dated to about 4.0 billion years ago the actions of plate tectonics and the oceans trap vast amounts of carbon dioxide thereby eliminating the greenhouse effect and leading to a much cooler surface temperature and the formation of solid rock and possibly even life
