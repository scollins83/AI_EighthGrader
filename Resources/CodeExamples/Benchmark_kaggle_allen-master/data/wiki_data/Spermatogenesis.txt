spermatogenesis is the process in which spermatozoa are produced from male primordial germ cells by way of mitosis and meiosis the initial cells in this pathway are called spermatogonia which yield primary spermatocytes by mitosis the primary spermatocyte divides meiotically (meiosis i) into two secondary spermatocytes; each secondary spermatocyte divides into two spermatids by meiosis ii these develop into mature spermatozoa also known as sperm cells thus the primary spermatocyte gives rise to two cells the secondary spermatocytes and the two secondary spermatocytes by their subdivision produce four spermatozoa
spermatozoa are the mature male gametes in many sexually reproducing organisms thus spermatogenesis is the male version of gametogenesis of which the female equivalent is oogenesis in mammals it occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the male testes in a stepwise fashion spermatogenesis is highly dependent upon optimal conditions for the process to occur correctly and is essential for sexual reproduction dna methylation and histone modification have been implicated in the regulation of this process it starts at puberty and usually continues uninterrupted until death although a slight decrease can be discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see male infertility)
== purpose ==
spermatogenesis produces mature male gametes commonly called sperm but specifically known as spermatozoa which are able to fertilize the counterpart female gamete the oocyte during conception to produce a single-celled individual known as a zygote this is the cornerstone of sexual reproduction and involves the two gametes both contributing half the normal set of chromosomes (haploid) to result in a chromosomally normal (diploid) zygote
to preserve the number of chromosomes in the offspring which differs between species each gamete must have half the usual number of chromosomes present in other body cells otherwise the offspring will have twice the normal number of chromosomes and serious abnormalities may result in humans chromosomal abnormalities arising from incorrect spermatogenesis results in congenital defects and abnormal birth defects (down syndrome klinefelter's syndrome) and in most cases spontaneous abortion of the developing fetus
== location ==
spermatogenesis takes place within several structures of the male reproductive system the initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the epididymis where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation the seminiferous tubules of the testes are the starting point for the process where stem cells adjacent to the inner tubule wall divide in a centripetal directionbeginning at the walls and proceeding into the innermost part or lumento produce immature sperm maturation occurs in the epididymis the location [testes/scrotum] is specifically important as the process of spermatogenesis requires a lower temperature to produce viable sperm specifically 1-8 c lower than normal body temperature of 37 c (98.6 f) clinically small fluctuations in temperature such as from an athletic support strap causes no impairment in sperm viability or count
== duration ==
for humans the entire process of spermatogenesis is variously estimated as taking 74 days (according to tritium-labelled biopsies) and approximately 120 days (according to dna clock measurements) including the transport on ductal system it takes 3 months testes produce 200 to 300 million spermatozoa daily however only about half or 100 million of these become viable sperm
== stages ==
the entire process of spermatogenesis can be broken up into several distinct stages each corresponding to a particular type of cell in human in the following table ploidy copy number and chromosome/chromatid counts are for one cell generally prior to dna synthesis and division (in g1 if applicable) the primary spermatocyte is arrested after dna synthesis and prior to division
=== spermatocytogenesis ===
spermatocytogenesis is the male form of gametocytogenesis and results in the formation of spermatocytes possessing half the normal complement of genetic material in spermatocytogenesis a diploid spermatogonium which resides in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules divides mitotically producing two diploid intermediate cells called primary spermatocytes each primary spermatocyte then moves into the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubules and duplicates its dna and subsequently undergoes meiosis i to produce two haploid secondary spermatocytes which will later divide once more into haploid spermatids this division implicates sources of genetic variation such as random inclusion of either parental chromosomes and chromosomal crossover to increase the genetic variability of the gamete
each cell division from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected to one another by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development it should also be noted that not all spermatogonia divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise the supply of spermatogonia would run out instead certain types of spermatogonia divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel spermatogenesis
=== spermatidogenesis ===
spermatidogenesis is the creation of spermatids from secondary spermatocytes secondary spermatocytes produced earlier rapidly enter meiosis ii and divide to produce haploid spermatids the brevity of this stage means that secondary spermatocytes are rarely seen in histological studies
=== spermiogenesis ===
during spermiogenesis the spermatids begin to form a tail by growing microtubules on one of the centrioles which turns into basal body these microtubules form an axoneme the anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply spermatid dna also undergoes packaging becoming highly condensed the dna is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation the resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive the golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus becoming the acrosome
maturation then takes place under the influence of testosterone which removes the remaining unnecessary cytoplasm and organelles the excess cytoplasm known as residual bodies is phagocytosed by surrounding sertoli cells in the testes the resulting spermatozoa are now mature but lack motility rendering them sterile the mature spermatozoa are released from the protective sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule in a process called spermiation
the non-motile spermatozoa are transported to the epididymis in testicular fluid secreted by the sertoli cells with the aid of peristaltic contraction while in the epididymis the spermatozoa gain motility and become capable of fertilization however transport of the mature spermatozoa through the remainder of the male reproductive system is achieved via muscle contraction rather than the spermatozoon's recently acquired motility
== role of sertoli cells ==
at all stages of differentiation the spermatogenic cells are in close contact with sertoli cells which are thought to provide structural and metabolic support to the developing sperm cells a single sertoli cell extends from the basement membrane to the lumen of the seminiferous tubule although the cytoplasmic processes are difficult to distinguish at the light microscopic level
sertoli cells serve a number of functions during spermatogenesis they support the developing gametes in the following ways:
maintain the environment necessary for development and maturation via the blood-testis barrier
secrete substances initiating meiosis
secrete supporting testicular fluid
secrete androgen-binding protein (abp) which concentrates testosterone in close proximity to the developing gametes
testosterone is needed in very high quantities for maintenance of the reproductive tract and abp allows a much higher level of fertility
secrete hormones affecting pituitary gland control of spermatogenesis particularly the polypeptide hormone inhibin
phagocytose residual cytoplasm left over from spermiogenesis
secretion of anti-mllerian hormone causes deterioration of the mllerian duct
protect spermatids from the immune system of the male via the blood-testis barrier
the intercellular adhesion molecules icam-1 and soluble icam-1 have antagonistic effects on the tight junctions forming the blood-testis barrier icam-2 molecules regulate spermatid adhesion on the apical side of the barrier (towards the lumen)
== influencing factors ==
the process of spermatogenesis is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the environment particularly hormones and temperature testosterone is required in large local concentrations to maintain the process which is achieved via the binding of testosterone by androgen binding protein present in the seminiferous tubules testosterone is produced by interstitial cells also known as leydig cells which reside adjacent to the seminiferous tubules
seminiferous epithelium is sensitive to elevated temperature in humans and some other species and will be adversely affected by temperatures as high as normal body temperature consequently the testes are located outside the body in a sack of skin called the scrotum the optimal temperature is maintained at 2 c (man)8 c (mouse) below body temperature this is achieved by regulation of blood flow and positioning towards and away from the heat of the body by the cremasteric muscle and the dartos smooth muscle in the scrotum
dietary deficiencies (such as vitamins b e and a) anabolic steroids metals (cadmium and lead) x-ray exposure dioxin alcohol and infectious diseases will also adversely affect the rate of spermatogenesis in addition the male germ line is susceptible to dna damage caused by oxidative stress and this damage likely has a significant impact on fertilization and pregnancy exposure to pesticides also affects spermatogenesis
== hormonal control ==
hormonal control of spermatogenesis varies among species in humans the mechanism is not completely understood; however it is known that initiation of spermatogenesis occurs at puberty due to the interaction of the hypothalamus pituitary gland and leydig cells if the pituitary gland is removed spermatogenesis can still be initiated by follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) and testosterone in contrast to fsh lh is thought to have little role in spermatogenesis outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production
fsh stimulates both the production of androgen binding protein (abp) by sertoli cells and the formation of the blood-testis barrier abp is essential to concentrating testosterone in levels high enough to initiate and maintain spermatogenesis which can be 20100 times higher than the concentration found in blood fsh may initiate the sequestering of testosterone in the testes but once developed only testosterone is required to maintain spermatogenesis however increasing the levels of fsh will increase the production of spermatozoa by preventing the apoptosis of type a spermatogonia the hormone inhibin acts to decrease the levels of fsh studies from rodent models suggest that gonadotropins (both lh and fsh) support the process of spermatogenesis by suppressing the proapoptotic signals and therefore promote spermatogenic cell survival
the sertoli cells themselves mediate parts of spermatogenesis through hormone production they are capable of producing the hormones estradiol and inhibin the leydig cells are also capable of producing estradiol in addition to their main product testosterone estrogen has been found to be essential for spermatogenesis although levels that are too high can also be detrimental due to suppression of gonadotropin secretion and intratesticular testosterone production prolactin also appears to be important for spermatogenesis
