a prokaryote is a single-celled organism that lacks a membrane-bound nucleus (karyon) mitochondria or any other membrane-bound organelle the word prokaryote comes from the greek - (pro-) "before" and (karyon) "nut or kernel" prokaryotes can be divided into two domains archaea and bacteria with the remainder of species called eukaryotes in the third domain eukaryota
in the prokaryotes all the intracellular water-soluble components (proteins dna and metabolites) are located together in the cytoplasm enclosed by the cell membrane rather than in separate cellular compartments bacteria however do possess protein-based bacterial microcompartments which are thought to act as primitive organelles enclosed in protein shells some prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria may form large colonies others such as myxobacteria have multicellular stages in their life cycles
molecular studies have provided insight into the evolution and interrelationships of the three domains of biological species eukaryotes are organisms including humans whose cells have a well defined membrane-bound nucleus (containing chromosomal dna) and organelles the division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects the existence of two very different levels of cellular organization distinctive types of prokaryotes include extremophiles and methanogens; these are common in some extreme environments
== structureedit ==
prokaryotes have a prokaryotic cytoskeleton albeit more primitive than that of the eukaryotes besides homologues of actin and tubulin (mreb and ftsz) the helically arranged building-block of the flagellum flagellin is one of the most significant cytoskeletal proteins of bacteria as it provides structural backgrounds of chemotaxis the basic cell physiological response of bacteria at least some prokaryotes also contain intracellular structures that can be seen as primitive organelles membranous organelles (or intracellular membranes) are known in some groups of prokaryotes such as vacuoles or membrane systems devoted to special metabolic properties such as photosynthesis or chemolithotrophy in addition some species also contain protein-enclosed microcompartments which have distinct physiological roles (e.g carboxysomes or gas vacuoles)
most prokaryotes are between 1 m and 10 m but they can vary in size from 0.2 m to 750 m (thiomargarita namibiensis)
== morphology of prokaryotic cellsedit ==
prokaryotic cells have various shapes; the four basic shapes of bacteria are:
cocci spherical
bacilli rod-shaped
spirochaete spiral-shaped
vibrio comma-shaped
the archaeon haloquadratum has flat square-shaped cells
== reproductionedit ==
bacteria and archaea reproduce through asexual reproduction usually by binary fission genetic exchange and recombination still occur but this is a form of horizontal gene transfer and is not a replicative process simply involving the transference of dna between two cells as in bacterial conjugation
== dna transferedit ==
dna transfer between prokaryotic cells occurs in bacteria and archaea although it has been mainly studied in bacteria in bacteria gene transfer occurs by three processes these are (1) bacterial virus (bacteriophage)-mediated transduction (2) plasmid-mediated conjugation and (3) natural transformation transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to reflect an occasional error during intracellular assembly of virus particles rather than an adaptation of the host bacteria the transfer of bacterial dna is under the control of the bacteriophages genes rather than bacterial genes conjugation in the well-studied e coli system is controlled by plasmid genes and is an adaptation for distributing copies of a plasmid from one bacterial host to another infrequently during this process a plasmid may integrate into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfer part of the host bacterial dna to another bacterium plasmid mediated transfer of host bacterial dna (conjugation) also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation
natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of dna from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium unlike transduction and conjugation transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for dna transfer because it depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process for a bacterium to bind take up and recombine donor dna into its own chromosome it must first enter a special physiological state called competence about 40 genes are required in bacillus subtilis for the development of competence the length of dna transferred during b subtilis transformation can be as much as a third to the whole chromosome transformation is a common mode of dna transfer and 67 prokaryotic species are thus far known to be naturally competent for transformation
among archaea halobacterium volcanii forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of dna from one cell to another another archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus transfers dna between cells by direct contact frols et al found that exposure of s solfataricus to dna damaging agents induces cellular aggregation and suggested that cellular aggregation may enhance dna transfer among cells to provide increased repair of damaged dna via homologous recombination
== socialityedit ==
while prokaryotes are considered strictly unicellular most can form stable aggregate communities when such communities are encased in a stabilizing polymer matrix ("slime") they may be called "biofilms" cells in biofilms often show distinct patterns of gene expression (phenotypic differentiation) in time and space also as with multicellular eukaryotes these changes in expression often appear to result from cell-to-cell signaling a phenomenon known as quorum sensing
biofilms may be highly heterogeneous and structurally complex and may attach to solid surfaces or exist at liquid-air interfaces or potentially even liquid-liquid interfaces bacterial biofilms are often made up of microcolonies (approximately dome-shaped masses of bacteria and matrix) separated by "voids" through which the medium (e.g. water) may flow relatively uninhibited the microcolonies may join together above the substratum to form a continuous layer closing the network of channels separating microcolonies this structural complexitycombined with observations that oxygen limitation (a ubiquitous challenge for anything growing in size beyond the scale of diffusion) is at least partially eased by movement of medium throughout the biofilmhas led some to speculate that this may constitute a circulatory system and many researchers have started calling prokaryotic communities multicellular (for example ) differential cell expression collective behavior signaling programmed cell death and (in some cases) discrete biological dispersal events all seem to point in this direction however these colonies are seldom if ever founded by a single founder (in the way that animals and plants are founded by single cells) which presents a number of theoretical issues most explanations of co-operation and the evolution of multicellularity have focused on high relatedness between members of a group (or colony or whole organism) if a copy of a gene is present in all members of a group behaviors that promote cooperation between members may permit those members to have (on average) greater fitness than a similar group of selfish individuals (see inclusive fitness and hamilton's rule)
should these instances of prokaryotic sociality prove to be the rule rather than the exception it would have serious implications for the way we view prokaryotes in general and the way we deal with them in medicine bacterial biofilms may be 100 times more resistant to antibiotics than free-living unicells and may be nearly impossible to remove from surfaces once they have colonized them other aspects of bacterial cooperationsuch as bacterial conjugation and quorum-sensing-mediated pathogenicity present additional challenges to researchers and medical professionals seeking to treat the associated diseases
== environmentedit ==
prokaryotes have diversified greatly throughout their long existence the metabolism of prokaryotes is far more varied than that of eukaryotes leading to many highly distinct prokaryotic types for example in addition to using photosynthesis or organic compounds for energy as eukaryotes do prokaryotes may obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide this enables prokaryotes to thrive in harsh environments as cold as the snow surface of antarctica studied in cryobiology or as hot as undersea hydrothermal vents and land-based hot springs
prokaryotes live in nearly all environments on earth some archaea and bacteria thrive in harsh conditions such as high temperatures (thermophiles) or high salinity (halophiles) organisms such as these are referred to as extremophiles many archaea grow as plankton in the oceans symbiotic prokaryotes live in or on the bodies of other organisms including humans
== classificationedit ==
in 1977 carl woese proposed dividing prokaryotes into the bacteria and archaea (originally eubacteria and archaebacteria) because of the major differences in the structure and genetics between the two groups of organisms archaea were originally thought to be extremophiles living only in inhospitable conditions such as extremes of temperature ph and radiation but have since been found in all types of habitats the resulting arrangement of eukaryota (also called "eukarya") bacteria and archaea is called the three-domain system replacing the traditional two-empire system
one criticism of the dichotomous prokaryote-eukaryote distinction points out that the word "prokaryote" is based on what these organisms are not (they are not eukaryotic) rather than what they are (either archaea or bacteria)
== evolution of prokaryotesedit ==
the current model of the evolution of the first living organisms is that these were some form of prokaryotes which may have evolved out of protocells in general the eukaryotes are thought to have evolved later in the history of life
however some authors have questioned this conclusion arguing that the current set of prokaryotic species may have evolved from more complex eukaryotic ancestors through a process of simplification
others have argued that the three domains of life arose simultaneously from a set of varied cells that formed a single gene pool
this controversy was summarized in 2005:
there is no consensus among biologists concerning the position of the eukaryotes in the overall scheme of cell evolution current opinions on the origin and position of eukaryotes span a broad spectrum including the views that eukaryotes arose first in evolution and that prokaryotes descend from them that eukaryotes arose contemporaneously with eubacteria and archeabacteria and hence represent a primary line of descent of equal age and rank as the prokaryotes that eukaryotes arose through a symbiotic event entailing an endosymbiotic origin of the nucleus that eukaryotes arose without endosymbiosis and that eukaryotes arose through a symbiotic event entailing a simultaneous endosymbiotic origin of the flagellum and the nucleus in addition to many other models which have been reviewed and summarized elsewhere
the oldest known fossilized prokaryotes were laid down approximately 3.5 billion years ago only about 1 billion years after the formation of the earth's crust eukaryotes only appear in the fossil record later and may have formed from endosymbiosis of multiple prokaryote ancestors the oldest known fossil eukaryotes are about 1.7 billion years old however some genetic evidence suggests eukaryotes appeared as early as 3 billion years ago
while earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist some have suggested that there is evidence on mars of fossil or living prokaryotes; but this possibility remains the subject of considerable debate and skepticism
== relationship to eukaryotesedit ==
the division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is usually considered the most important distinction or difference among organisms the distinction is that eukaryotic cells have a "true" nucleus containing their dna whereas prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus both eukaryotes and prokaryotes contain large rna/protein structures called ribosomes which produce protein
another difference is that ribosomes in prokaryotes are smaller than in eukaryotes however two organelles found in many eukaryotic cells mitochondria and chloroplasts contain ribosomes similar in size and makeup to those found in prokaryotes this is one of many pieces of evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts are themselves descended from free-living bacteria this theory holds that early eukaryotic cells took in primitive prokaryotic cells by phagocytosis and adapted themselves to incorporate their structures leading to the mitochondria we see today
the genome in a prokaryote is held within a dna/protein complex in the cytosol called the nucleoid which lacks a nuclear envelope the complex contains a single cyclic double-stranded molecule of stable chromosomal dna in contrast to the multiple linear compact highly organized chromosomes found in eukaryotic cells in addition many important genes of prokaryotes are stored in separate circular dna structures called plasmids
prokaryotes lack mitochondria and chloroplasts instead processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis take place across the prokaryotic cell membrane however prokaryotes do possess some internal structures such as prokaryotic cytoskeletons it has been suggested that the bacterial order planctomycetes have a membrane around their nucleoid and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures however further investigation revealed that planctomycetes cells are not compartmentalized or nucleated and like the other bacterial membrane systems are all interconnected
prokaryotic cells are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells therefore prokaryotes have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio giving them a higher metabolic rate a higher growth rate and as a consequence a shorter generation time than eukaryotes
