in physics an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space for example the orbit of a planet around the center of a star system such as the solar system orbits of planets are typically elliptical but unlike the ellipse followed by a pendulum or an object attached to a spring the central object is at a focal point of the ellipse and not at its center
current understanding of the mechanics of orbital motion is based on albert einstein's general theory of relativity which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of space-time with orbits following geodesics for ease of calculation relativity is commonly approximated by the force-based theory of universal gravitation based on kepler's laws of planetary motion
== history ==
historically the apparent motions of the planets were first understood geometrically (and without regard to gravity) in terms of epicycles which are the sums of numerous circular motions theories of this kind predicted paths of the planets moderately well until johannes kepler was able to show that the motions of planets were in fact (at least approximately) elliptical motions
in the geocentric model of the solar system the celestial spheres model was originally used to explain the apparent motion of the planets in the sky in terms of perfect spheres or rings but after the planets' motions were more accurately measured theoretical mechanisms such as deferent and epicycles were added although it was capable of accurately predicting the planets' position in the sky more and more epicycles were required over time and the model became more and more unwieldy
the basis for the modern understanding of orbits was first formulated by johannes kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion first he found that the orbits of the planets in our solar system are elliptical not circular (or epicyclic) as had previously been believed and that the sun is not located at the center of the orbits but rather at one focus second he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant as had previously been thought but rather that the speed depends on the planet's distance from the sun third kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the sun for the planets the cubes of their distances from the sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods jupiter and venus for example are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 au distant from the sun their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years the proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for jupiter 5.23/11.862 is practically equal to that for venus 0.7233/0.6152 in accord with the relationship
isaac newton demonstrated that kepler's laws were derivable from his theory of gravitation and that in general the orbits of bodies subject to gravity were conic sections if the force of gravity propagated instantaneously newton showed that for a pair of bodies the orbits' sizes are in inverse proportion to their masses and that the bodies revolve about their common center of mass where one body is much more massive than the other it is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as coinciding with the center of the more massive body
albert einstein was able to show that gravity was due to curvature of space-time and thus he was able to remove newton's assumption that changes propagate instantaneously in relativity theory orbits follow geodesic trajectories which approximate very well to the newtonian predictions however there are differences that can be used to determine which theory describes reality more accurately essentially all experimental evidence that can distinguish between the theories agrees with relativity theory to within experimental measurement accuracy but the differences from newtonian mechanics are usually very small (except where there are very strong gravity fields and very high speeds) the first calculation of the relativistic distortion came from the speed of mercury's orbit and the strength of the solar gravity field because these are enough to cause mercury's orbital elements to change
however newton's solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier to use
== planetary orbits ==
within a planetary system planets dwarf planets asteroids and other minor planets comets and space debris orbit the barycenter in elliptical orbits a comet in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit about a barycenter is not gravitationally bound to the star and therefore is not considered part of the star's planetary system bodies which are gravitationally bound to one of the planets in a planetary system either natural or artificial satellites follow orbits about a barycenter near or within that planet
owing to mutual gravitational perturbations the eccentricities of the planetary orbits vary over time mercury the smallest planet in the solar system has the most eccentric orbit at the present epoch mars has the next largest eccentricity while the smallest orbital eccentricities are seen in venus and neptune
as two objects orbit each other the periapsis is that point at which the two objects are closest to each other and the apoapsis is that point at which they are the farthest from each other (more specific terms are used for specific bodies for example perigee and apogee are the lowest and highest parts of an orbit around earth while perihelion and aphelion are the closest and farthest points of an orbit around the sun.)
in the elliptical orbit the center of mass of the orbiting-orbited system is at one focus of both orbits with nothing present at the other focus as a planet approaches periapsis the planet will increase in speed or velocity as a planet approaches apoapsis its velocity will decrease
=== understanding orbits ===
there are a few common ways of understanding orbits:
as the object moves sideways it falls toward the central body however it moves so quickly that the central body will curve away beneath it
a force such as gravity pulls the object into a curved path as it attempts to fly off in a straight line
as the object moves sideways (tangentially) it falls toward the central body however it has enough tangential velocity to miss the orbited object and will continue falling indefinitely this understanding is particularly useful for mathematical analysis because the object's motion can be described as the sum of the three one-dimensional coordinates oscillating around a gravitational center
as an illustration of an orbit around a planet the newton's cannonball model may prove useful (see image below) this is a 'thought experiment' in which a cannon on top of a tall mountain is able to fire a cannonball horizontally at any chosen muzzle velocity the effects of air friction on the cannonball are ignored (or perhaps the mountain is high enough that the cannon will be above the earth's atmosphere which comes to the same thing)
if the cannon fires its ball with a low initial velocity the trajectory of the ball curves downward and hits the ground (a) as the firing velocity is increased the cannonball hits the ground farther (b) away from the cannon because while the ball is still falling towards the ground the ground is increasingly curving away from it (see first point above) all these motions are actually "orbits" in a technical sense they are describing a portion of an elliptical path around the center of gravity but the orbits are interrupted by striking the earth
if the cannonball is fired with sufficient velocity the ground curves away from the ball at least as much as the ball falls so the ball never strikes the ground it is now in what could be called a non-interrupted or circumnavigating orbit for any specific combination of height above the center of gravity and mass of the planet there is one specific firing velocity (unaffected by the mass of the ball which is assumed to be very small relative to the earth's mass) that produces a circular orbit as shown in (c)
as the firing velocity is increased beyond this elliptic orbits are produced; one is shown in (d) if the initial firing is above the surface of the earth as shown there will also be elliptical orbits at slower velocities; these will come closest to the earth at the point half an orbit beyond and directly opposite the firing point
at a specific velocity called escape velocity again dependent on the firing height and mass of the planet an open orbit such as (e) results a parabolic trajectory at even faster velocities the object will follow a range of hyperbolic trajectories in a practical sense both of these trajectory types mean the object is "breaking free" of the planet's gravity and "going off into space"
the velocity relationship of two moving objects with mass can thus be considered in four practical classes with subtypes:
no orbit
suborbital trajectories
range of interrupted elliptical paths
orbital trajectories (or simply "orbits")
range of elliptical paths with closest point opposite firing point
circular path
range of elliptical paths with closest point at firing point
open (or escape) trajectories
parabolic paths
hyperbolic paths
it is worth noting that actual rockets launched from earth go vertically at first to get through the air (which causes frictional drag) then slowly pitch over and end firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbit
then their orbits keep them above the atmosphere if e.g. an elliptical orbit dips into dense air the object will lose speed and re-enter (i.e fall) occasionally a space craft will intentionally intercept the atmosphere in an act commonly referred to as an aerobraking maneuver
== newton's laws of motion ==
=== newton's law of gravitation and laws of motion for two-body problems ===
in many situations relativistic effects can be neglected and newton's laws give a highly accurate description of the motion the acceleration of each body is equal to the sum of the gravitational forces on it divided by its mass and the gravitational force between each pair of bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and decreases inversely with the square of the distance between them to this newtonian approximation for a system of two point masses or spherical bodies only influenced by their mutual gravitation (the two-body problem) the orbits can be exactly calculated if the heavier body is much more massive than the smaller as for a satellite or small moon orbiting a planet or for the earth orbiting the sun it is accurate and convenient to describe the motion in a coordinate system that is centered on the heavier body and we say that the lighter body is in orbit around the heavier for the case where the masses of two bodies are comparable an exact newtonian solution is still available and qualitatively similar to the case of dissimilar masses by centering the coordinate system on the center of mass of the two
=== defining gravitational potential energy ===
energy is associated with gravitational fields a stationary body far from another can do external work if it is pulled towards it and therefore has gravitational potential energy since work is required to separate two bodies against the pull of gravity their gravitational potential energy increases as they are separated and decreases as they approach one another for point masses the gravitational energy decreases without limit as they approach zero separation and it is convenient and conventional to take the potential energy as zero when they are an infinite distance apart and then negative (since it decreases from zero) for smaller finite distances
=== orbital energies and orbit shapes ===
with two bodies an orbit is a conic section the orbit can be open (so the object never returns) or closed (returning) depending on the total energy (kinetic + potential energy) of the system in the case of an open orbit the speed at any position of the orbit is at least the escape velocity for that position in the case of a closed orbit always less since the kinetic energy is never negative if the common convention is adopted of taking the potential energy as zero at infinite separation the bound orbits have negative total energy parabolic trajectories have zero total energy and hyperbolic orbits have positive total energy
an open orbit has the shape of a hyperbola (when the velocity is greater than the escape velocity) or a parabola (when the velocity is exactly the escape velocity) the bodies approach each other for a while curve around each other around the time of their closest approach and then separate again forever this may be the case with some comets if they come from outside the solar system
a closed orbit has the shape of an ellipse in the special case that the orbiting body is always the same distance from the center it is also the shape of a circle otherwise the point where the orbiting body is closest to earth is the perigee called periapsis (less properly "perifocus" or "pericentron") when the orbit is around a body other than earth the point where the satellite is farthest from earth is called apogee apoapsis or sometimes apifocus or apocentron a line drawn from periapsis to apoapsis is the line-of-apsides this is the major axis of the ellipse the line through its longest part
=== kepler's laws ===
orbiting bodies in closed orbits repeat their paths after a constant period of time this motion is described by the empirical laws of kepler which can be mathematically derived from newton's laws these can be formulated as follows:
the orbit of a planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun in one of the focal points of the ellipse [this focal point is actually the barycenter of the sun-planet system; for simplicity this explanation assumes the sun's mass is infinitely larger than that planet's.] the orbit lies in a plane called the orbital plane the point on the orbit closest to the attracting body is the periapsis the point farthest from the attracting body is called the apoapsis there are also specific terms for orbits around particular bodies; things orbiting the sun have a perihelion and aphelion things orbiting the earth have a perigee and apogee and things orbiting the moon have a perilune and apolune (or periselene and aposelene respectively) an orbit around any star not just the sun has a periastron and an apastron
as the planet moves around its orbit during a fixed amount of time the line from the sun to planet sweeps a constant area of the orbital plane regardless of which part of its orbit the planet traces during that period of time this means that the planet moves faster near its perihelion than near its aphelion because at the smaller distance it needs to trace a greater arc to cover the same area this law is usually stated as "equal areas in equal time."
for a given orbit the ratio of the cube of its semi-major axis to the square of its period is constant
=== limitations of newton's law of gravitation ===
note that while bound orbits around a point mass or around a spherical body with a newtonian gravitational field are closed ellipses which repeat the same path exactly and indefinitely any non-spherical or non-newtonian effects (as caused for example by the slight oblateness of the earth or by relativistic effects changing the gravitational field's behavior with distance) will cause the orbit's shape to depart from the closed ellipses characteristic of newtonian two-body motion the two-body solutions were published by newton in principia in 1687 in 1912 karl fritiof sundman developed a converging infinite series that solves the three-body problem; however it converges too slowly to be of much use except for special cases like the lagrangian points no method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies
=== approaches to many-body problems ===
instead orbits with many bodies can be approximated with arbitrarily high accuracy these approximations take two forms:
one form takes the pure elliptic motion as a basis and adds perturbation terms to account for the gravitational influence of multiple bodies this is convenient for calculating the positions of astronomical bodies the equations of motion of the moons planets and other bodies are known with great accuracy and are used to generate tables for celestial navigation still there are secular phenomena that have to be dealt with by post-newtonian methods
the differential equation form is used for scientific or mission-planning purposes according to newton's laws the sum of all the forces will equal the mass times its acceleration (f = ma) therefore accelerations can be expressed in terms of positions the perturbation terms are much easier to describe in this form predicting subsequent positions and velocities from initial values corresponds to solving an initial value problem numerical methods calculate the positions and velocities of the objects a short time in the future then repeat the calculation however tiny arithmetic errors from the limited accuracy of a computer's math are cumulative which limits the accuracy of this approach
differential simulations with large numbers of objects perform the calculations in a hierarchical pairwise fashion between centers of mass using this scheme galaxies star clusters and other large objects have been simulated
== newtonian analysis of orbital motion ==
(see also kepler orbit orbit equation and kepler's first law.)
the earth follows an ellipse round the sun but unlike the ellipse followed by a pendulum or an object attached to a spring the sun is at a focal point of the ellipse and not at its centre
the following derives mathematically this orbit as newton would have done we start only with the newtonian law that the gravitational acceleration towards the central body is related to the inverse of the square of the distance between them
where is the standard gravitational parameter in this case  we assume that the central body is heavy enough that it can be considered to be stationary and we ignore the more subtle effects of general relativity
when a pendulum or an object attached to a spring swings in an ellipse the inward acceleration/force is proportionate to the distance due to the way vectors add the component of the force in the or in the directions are also proportionate to the respective components of the distances  hence the entire analysis can be done separately in these dimensions this results in the harmonic parabolic equations and of the ellipse but with the decreasing relationship  the dimensions cannot be separated
the reason that the sun is at the focal point of the orbit's ellipse and not at the centre is because if the object is moving really fast then as it moves out the gravitational pull decreases allowing the object to almost escape if it does not quite escape then its orbit cycles around first as a parabola but then when quite far away it slowly circles back it picks up speed as it falls only to boomerang back out into space again
the location of the orbiting object at the current time is located in the plane using vector calculus in polar coordinates both with the standard euclidean basis and with the polar basis with the origin coinciding with the center of force let be the distance between the object and the center and be the angle it has rotated let and be the standard euclidean bases and let and be the radial and transverse polar basis with the first being the unit vector pointing from the central body to the current location of the orbiting object and the second being the orthogonal unit vector pointing in the direction that the orbiting object would travel if orbiting in a counter clockwise circle then the vector to the orbiting object is
we use and to denote the standard derivatives of how this distance and angle change over time but we also take the derivative of a vector to see how it changes over time by subtracting its location at time from that at time and dividing by  the result is also a vector because our basis vector moves as the object orbits we start by differentiating it from time to  the vector keeps its beginning at the origin and rotates from angle to which moves its head a distance in the perpendicular direction giving a derivative of 
we can now find the velocity and acceleration of our orbiting object
the coefficients of and are the radial and transverse components of the acceleration as said newton gives that this first due to gravity is and the second is zero
equation (2) can be rearranged using integration by parts
we can divide through by because it is not zero unless the orbiting object crashes then having the derivative be zero gives that the function is a constant
which is actually the theoretical proof of kepler's second law (a line joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time) the constant of integration h is the angular momentum per unit mass
in order to get an equation for the orbit from equation (1) we need to eliminate time (see also binet equation.) in polar coordinates this would express the distance of the orbiting object from the center as a function of its angle  however it is easier to introduced the auxiliary variable and to express as a function of  derivatives of with respect to time may be rewritten as derivatives of with respect to angle
(reworking (3))
plugging these into (1) gives
so for the gravitational force or more generally for any inverse square force law the right hand side of the equation becomes a constant and the equation is seen to be the harmonic equation (up to a shift of origin of the dependent variable) the solution is:
where a and 0 are arbitrary constants this resulting equation of the orbit of the object is that of an ellipse in polar form relative to one of the focal points this is put into a more standard form by letting be the eccentricity letting be the semi-major axis finally letting so the long axis of the ellipse is along the positive x coordinate
== relativistic orbital motion ==
the above classical (newtonian) analysis of orbital mechanics assumes that the more subtle effects of general relativity such as frame dragging and gravitational time dilation are negligible relativistic effects cease to be negligible when near very massive bodies (as with the precession of mercury's orbit about the sun) or when extreme precision is needed (as with calculations of the orbital elements and time signal references for gps satellites.)
== orbital planes ==
the analysis so far has been two dimensional; it turns out that an unperturbed orbit is two-dimensional in a plane fixed in space and thus the extension to three dimensions requires simply rotating the two-dimensional plane into the required angle relative to the poles of the planetary body involved
the rotation to do this in three dimensions requires three numbers to uniquely determine; traditionally these are expressed as three angles
== orbital period ==
the orbital period is simply how long an orbiting body takes to complete one orbit
== specifying orbits ==
six parameters are required to specify a keplerian orbit about a body for example the three numbers that specify the body's initial position and the three values that specify its velocity will define a unique orbit that can be calculated forwards (or backwards) however traditionally the parameters used are slightly different
the traditionally used set of orbital elements is called the set of keplerian elements after johannes kepler and his laws the keplerian elements are six:
inclination (i)
longitude of the ascending node ()
argument of periapsis ()
eccentricity (e)
semimajor axis (a)
mean anomaly at epoch (m0)
in principle once the orbital elements are known for a body its position can be calculated forward and backwards indefinitely in time however in practice orbits are affected or perturbed by other forces than simple gravity from an assumed point source (see the next section) and thus the orbital elements change over time
== orbital perturbations ==
an orbital perturbation is when a force or impulse which is much smaller than the overall force or average impulse of the main gravitating body and which is external to the two orbiting bodies causes an acceleration which changes the parameters of the orbit over time
=== radial prograde and transverse perturbations ===
a small radial impulse given to a body in orbit changes the eccentricity but not the orbital period (to first order) a prograde or retrograde impulse (i.e an impulse applied along the orbital motion) changes both the eccentricity and the orbital period notably a prograde impulse at periapsis raises the altitude at apoapsis and vice versa and a retrograde impulse does the opposite a transverse impulse (out of the orbital plane) causes rotation of the orbital plane without changing the period or eccentricity in all instances a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point
=== orbital decay ===
if an orbit is about a planetary body with significant atmosphere its orbit can decay because of drag particularly at each periapsis the object experiences atmospheric drag losing energy each time the orbit grows less eccentric (more circular) because the object loses kinetic energy precisely when that energy is at its maximum this is similar to the effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point; the highest point of the pendulum's swing becomes lower with each successive slowing more of the orbit's path is affected by the atmosphere and the effect becomes more pronounced eventually the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinetic energy is not enough to return the orbit above the limits of the atmospheric drag effect when this happens the body will rapidly spiral down and intersect the central body
the bounds of an atmosphere vary wildly during a solar maximum the earth's atmosphere causes drag up to a hundred kilometres higher than during a solar minimum
some satellites with long conductive tethers can also experience orbital decay because of electromagnetic drag from the earth's magnetic field as the wire cuts the magnetic field it acts as a generator moving electrons from one end to the other the orbital energy is converted to heat in the wire
orbits can be artificially influenced through the use of rocket engines which change the kinetic energy of the body at some point in its path this is the conversion of chemical or electrical energy to kinetic energy in this way changes in the orbit shape or orientation can be facilitated
another method of artificially influencing an orbit is through the use of solar sails or magnetic sails these forms of propulsion require no propellant or energy input other than that of the sun and so can be used indefinitely see statite for one such proposed use
orbital decay can occur due to tidal forces for objects below the synchronous orbit for the body they're orbiting the gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary and since below the synchronous orbit the orbiting object is moving faster than the body's surface the bulges lag a short angle behind it the gravity of the bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellite's motion the near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up and as a result the orbit decays conversely the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit but several moons in the solar system are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism mars' innermost moon phobos is a prime example and is expected to either impact mars' surface or break up into a ring within 50 million years
orbits can decay via the emission of gravitational waves this mechanism is extremely weak for most stellar objects only becoming significant in cases where there is a combination of extreme mass and extreme acceleration such as with black holes or neutron stars that are orbiting each other closely
=== oblateness ===
the standard analysis of orbiting bodies assumes that all bodies consist of uniform spheres or more generally concentric shells each of uniform density it can be shown that such bodies are gravitationally equivalent to point sources
however in the real world many bodies rotate and this introduces oblateness and distorts the gravity field and gives a quadrupole moment to the gravitational field which is significant at distances comparable to the radius of the body
=== multiple gravitating bodies ===
the effects of other gravitating bodies can be significant for example the orbit of the moon cannot be accurately described without allowing for the action of the sun's gravity as well as the earth's one approximate result is that bodies will usually have reasonably stable orbits around a heavier planet or moon in spite of these perturbations provided they are orbiting well within the heavier body's hill sphere
when there are more than two gravitating bodies it is referred to as an n-body problem most n-body problems have no closed form solution although some special cases have been formulated
=== light radiation and stellar wind ===
for smaller bodies particularly light and stellar wind can cause significant perturbations to the attitude and direction of motion of the body and over time can be significant of the planetary bodies the motion of asteroids is particularly affected over large periods when the asteroids are rotating relative to the sun
== astrodynamics ==
orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft the motion of these objects is usually calculated from newton's laws of motion and newton's law of universal gravitation it is a core discipline within space mission design and control celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems planets moons and comets orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories including orbital maneuvers orbit plane changes and interplanetary transfers and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers general relativity is a more exact theory than newton's laws for calculating orbits and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (such as orbits close to the sun)
== earth orbits ==
low earth orbit (leo): geocentric orbits with altitudes up to 2,000 km (01,240 miles)
medium earth orbit (meo): geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2,000 km (1,240 miles) to just below geosynchronous orbit at 35,786 kilometers (22,236 mi) also known as an intermediate circular orbit these are "most commonly at 20,200 kilometers (12,600 mi) or 20,650 kilometers (12,830 mi) with an orbital period of 12 hours."
both geosynchronous orbit (gso) and geostationary orbit (geo) are orbits around earth matching earth's sidereal rotation period all geosynchronous and geostationary orbits have a semi-major axis of 42,164 km (26,199 mi) all geostationary orbits are also geosynchronous but not all geosynchronous orbits are geostationary a geostationary orbit stays exactly above the equator whereas a geosynchronous orbit may swing north and south to cover more of the earth's surface both complete one full orbit of earth per sidereal day (relative to the stars not the sun)
high earth orbit: geocentric orbits above the altitude of geosynchronous orbit 35,786 km (22,240 miles)
== scaling in gravity ==
the gravitational constant g has been calculated as:
(6.6742 0.001) 1011 (kg/m3)1s2
thus the constant has dimension density1 time2 this corresponds to the following properties
scaling of distances (including sizes of bodies while keeping the densities the same) gives similar orbits without scaling the time: if for example distances are halved masses are divided by 8 gravitational forces by 16 and gravitational accelerations by 2 hence velocities are halved and orbital periods remain the same similarly when an object is dropped from a tower the time it takes to fall to the ground remains the same with a scale model of the tower on a scale model of the earth
scaling of distances while keeping the masses the same (in the case of point masses or by reducing the densities) gives similar orbits; if distances are multiplied by 4 gravitational forces and accelerations are divided by 16 velocities are halved and orbital periods are multiplied by 8
when all densities are multiplied by 4 orbits are the same; gravitational forces are multiplied by 16 and accelerations by 4 velocities are doubled and orbital periods are halved
when all densities are multiplied by 4 and all sizes are halved orbits are similar; masses are divided by 2 gravitational forces are the same gravitational accelerations are doubled hence velocities are the same and orbital periods are halved
in all these cases of scaling if densities are multiplied by 4 times are halved; if velocities are doubled forces are multiplied by 16
these properties are illustrated in the formula (derived from the formula for the orbital period)
for an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis a of a small body around a spherical body with radius r and average density  where t is the orbital period see also kepler's third law
