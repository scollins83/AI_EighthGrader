variation and evolution in plants is a book written by g ledyard stebbins published in 1950 it is one of the key publications embodying the modern evolutionary synthesis as the first comprehensive publication to discuss the relationship between genetics and natural selection in plants the book has been described by plant systematist peter h raven as "the most important book on plant evolution of the 20th century" and it remains one of the most cited texts on plant evolution.[1]
the book is based on the jesup lectures that stebbins delivered at columbia university in october and november 1946 and is a synthesis of his ideas and the then current research on the evolution of seed plants in terms of genetics
the book is written in fourteen parts:
description and analysis of variation patterns
examples of variation patterns within species and genera
the basis of individual variation
natural selection and variation in populations
genetic systems as factors in evolution
isolation and the origin of species
hybridization and its effects
polyploidy i: occurrence and nature of polyploid types
polyploidy ii: geographic distribution and significance of polyploidy
apomixis in relation to variation and evolution
structural hybridity and the genetic system
evolutionary trends i: the karyotype
evolutionary trends ii: external morphology
fossils modern distribution patterns and rates of evolution
the 643-page book cites more than 1,250 references and was the longest of the four books associated with the modern evolutionary synthesis the other key works of the modern evolutionary synthesis whose publication also followed their authors' jesup lectures are theodosius dobzhansky's genetics and the origin of species ernst mayr's systematics and the origin of species and george gaylord simpson's tempo and mode in evolution the great significance of variation and evolution in plants is that it effectively killed any serious belief in alternative mechanisms of evolution for plants such as lamarckian evolution or soft inheritance which were still upheld by some botanists.[2] stebbins book flowering plants: evolution above the species level was published in 1974 and was based on the prather lectures which he gave at harvard it is considered as an update to variation and evolution
in january 2000 a colloquium was held in irvine california to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of variation and evolution in plants.[3] a 16 chapter book entitled variation and evolution in plants and microorganisms: toward a new synthesis 50 years after stebbins (isbn 0-309-07099-6) was released to mark the occasion
