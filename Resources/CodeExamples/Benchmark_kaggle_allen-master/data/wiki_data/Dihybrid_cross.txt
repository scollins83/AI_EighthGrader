dihybrid cross is a cross between two pure lines (varieties strains) that differ in two observed traits in mendelian sense between the alleles of both these loci there is a relationship of complete dominance - recessive for example: rryy/rryy parents result in f1 offspring that are heterozygous for both r and y (rryy)
the rules of meiosis as they apply to the dihybrid are codified in mendel's first law and mendel's second law which are also called the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment respectively
for genes on separate chromosomes each allele pair shows independent segregation if the first filial generation (f1 generation) produces four identical offspring the second filial generation which occurs by crossing the members of the first filial generation shows a phenotypic (appearance) ratio of 9:3:3:1 where:
the 9 represents the proportion of individuals displaying both dominant traits
the first 3 represents the individuals displaying the first dominant trait and the second recessive trait
the second 3 represents those displaying the first recessive trait and second dominant trait
the 1 represents the homozygote displaying both recessive traits
