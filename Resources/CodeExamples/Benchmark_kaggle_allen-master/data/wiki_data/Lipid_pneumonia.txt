lipid pneumonia or lipoid pneumonia is a specific form of lung inflammation (pneumonia) that develops when lipids enter the bronchial tree the disorder is sometimes called cholesterol pneumonia in cases where that lipid is a factor
== history ==
laughlen first described lipid pneumonia in 1925 with infants that inhaled oil droplets it is a condition that has been seen as an occupational risk for commercial diving operations but documented cases are rare
== clinical manifestations ==
the pneumonia presents as a foreign body reaction causing cough dyspnoea and often fever haemoptysis has also been reported
== causes ==
sources of such lipids could be either exogenous or endogenous
exogenous: from outside the body for example inhaled nose drops with an oil base or accidental inhalation of cosmetic oil amiodarone is an anti-arrythmic known to cause this condition oil pulling has also been shown to be a cause at risk populations include the elderly developmentally delayed or persons with gastroesophageal reflux switching to water-soluble alternatives may be helpful in some situations
endogenous: from the body itself for example when an airway is obstructed it is often the case that distal to the obstruction lipid-laden macrophages (foamy macrophages) and giant cells fill the lumen of the disconnected airspace
== appearance ==
the gross appearance of a lipid pneumonia is that in which there is an ill-defined pale yellow area on the lung this yellow appearance explains the colloquial term "golden" pneumonia
at the microscopic scale foamy macrophages and giant cells are seen in the airways and the inflammatory response is visible in the parenchyma
== treatment ==
treatment is with corticosteroids and possibly intravenous immunoglobulins
== prognosis ==
endogenous lipoid pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis has been seen prior to the development of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in a child
