mount merapi gunung merapi (literally fire mountain in indonesian/javanese) is an active stratovolcano located on the border between central java and yogyakarta indonesia it is the most active volcano in indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548 it is located approximately 28 kilometres (17 mi) north of the large yogyakarta city (2.4 millions inhabitants for the metropolitan area) and thousands of people live on the flanks of the volcano with villages as high as 1,700 metres (5,600 ft) above sea level
smoke can be seen emerging from the mountaintop at least 300 days a year and several eruptions have caused fatalities pyroclastic flow from a large explosion killed 27 people on 22 november 1994 mostly in the town of muntilan west of the volcano another large eruption occurred in 2006 shortly before the yogyakarta earthquake in light of the hazards that merapi poses to populated areas it has been designated as one of the decade volcanoes
on 25 october 2010 the indonesian government raised the alert for mount merapi to its highest level and warned villagers in threatened areas to move to safer ground people living within a 20 km (12 mi) zone were told to evacuate officials said about 500 volcanic earthquakes had been recorded on the mountain over the weekend of 2324 october and that the magma had risen to about 1 kilometre (3,300 ft) below the surface due to the seismic activity on the afternoon of 25 october 2010 mount merapi erupted lava from its southern and southeastern slopes
the mountain was still erupting on 30 november 2010 however due to lowered eruptive activity on 3 december 2010 the official alert status was reduced to level 3 the volcano is now 2930 metres high 38 metres lower than before the 2010 eruptions
after a large eruption in 2010 the characteristic of mount merapi was changed on 18 november 2013 mount merapi burst smoke up to 2,000 meters high one of its first major phreatic eruptions after the 2010 eruption researchers said that this eruption occurred due to combined effect of hot volcanic gases and abundant rainfall
== etymology ==
the name merapi could be loosely translated as 'mountain of fire' the etymology of the name came from meru-api; from the javanese combined words; meru means "mountain" refer to mythical mountain of gods in hinduism and api means "fire"
== history ==
=== geological history ===
merapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern java it is situated at a subduction zone where the indo-australian plate is subducting under the sunda plate it is one of at least 129 active volcanoes in indonesia part of the volcano is located in the southeastern part of the pacific ring of firea section of fault lines stretching from the western hemisphere through japan and south east asia stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the merapi area began about 400,000 years ago and from then until about 10,000 years ago eruptions were typically effusive and the out flowing lava emitted was basaltic since then eruptions have become more explosive with viscous andesitic lavas often generating lava domes dome collapse has often generated pyroclastic flows and larger explosions which have resulted in eruption columns have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse
typically small eruptions occur every two to three years and larger ones every 1015 years or so notable eruptions often causing many deaths have occurred in 1006 1786 1822 1872 and 1930 thirteen villages were destroyed in the later one and 1400 people killed by pyroclastic flows
the very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central java with ash the volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the hindu kingdom of mataram; however the evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated
=== 2006 eruption ===
in april 2006 increased seismicity at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano's cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent authorities put the volcano's neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation on 19 april smoke from the crater reached a height of 400 metres (1,300 ft) compared to 75 metres (246 ft) the previous day on 23 april after nine surface tremors and some 156 multifaced quakes signalled movements of magma some 600 elderly and infant residents of the slopes were evacuated
by early may active lava flows had begun on 11 may with lava flow beginning to be constant some 17,000 people were ordered to be evacuated from the area and on 13 may indonesian authorities raised the alert status to the highest level ordering the immediate evacuation of all residents on the mountain many villagers defied the dangers posed by the volcano and returned to their villages fearing that their livestock and crops would be vulnerable to theft activity calmed by the middle of may
on 27 may a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck roughly 50 km (31 mi) southwest of merapi killing at least 5,000 and leaving at least 200,000 people homeless in the yogyakarta region heightening fears that merapi would "blow" the quake did not appear to be a long-period oscillation a seismic disturbance class that is increasingly associated with major volcanic eruptions a further 11,000 villagers were evacuated on 6 june as lava and superheated clouds of gas poured repeatedly down its upper slopes towards kaliadem a location that was located southeast of mt merapi the pyroclastic flows are known locally as "wedhus gembel" (javanese for "shaggy goat") there were two fatalities as the result of the eruption
=== 2010 eruption ===
in late october 2010 the center for volcanology and geological hazard mitigation geological agency (cvghm) (indonesian languagepusat vulkanologi & mitigasi bencana geologi badan geologi-pvmbg) reported that a pattern of increasing seismicity from merapi had begun to emerge in early september
observers at babadan 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) west and kaliurang 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the mountain reported hearing an avalanche on 12 september 2010 on 13 september 2010 white plumes were observed rising 800 metres (2,600 ft) above the crater lava dome inflation detected since march increased from background levels of 0.1 millimetres (0.0039 in) to 0.3 millimetres (0.012 in) per day to a rate of 11 millimetres (0.43 in) per day on 16 september on 19 september 2010 earthquakes continued to be numerous and the next day cvghm raised the alert level to 2 (on a scale of 14) lava from mount merapi in central java began flowing down the gendol river on 2324 october signalling the likelihood of an imminent eruption
on 25 october 2010 the indonesian government raised the alert for mount merapi to its highest level (4) and warned villagers in threatened areas to move to safer ground people living within a 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) zone were told to evacuate the evacuation orders affected at least 19,000 people; however the number that complied at the time remained unclear to authorities officials said about 500 volcanic earthquakes had been recorded on the mountain over the weekend of 2324 october and that the magma had risen to about 1 kilometre (3,300 ft) below the surface due to the seismic activity
after a period of multiple eruptions considered to exceed the intensity and duration of those in 1872 on 10 november 2010 the intensity and frequency of eruptions was noticed to subside by this time 153 people had been reported to have been killed and 320,000 were displaced later the eruptive activities again increased requiring a continuation of the level 4 alert and continued provision of exclusion zones around the volcano by 18 november the death toll had increased to 275 the toll had risen to 324 by 24 november and syamsul maarif head of the national disaster mitigation agency (bnpb) explained that the death toll had risen after a number of victims succumbed to severe burns and more bodies were found on the volcanos slopes
in the aftermath of the more intensive eruptive activities in late november yogyakartas disaster management agency reported that there were about 500 reported cases of eruption survivors in sleman district suffering from minor to severe psychological problems and about 300 cases in magelang by 3 december the death toll had risen to 353
on friday 3 december 2010 the head of the national disaster management agency (bnpb) dr syamsul maarif m si accompanied by the head of the centre for volcanology and geological hazard mitigation cvghm (pvmbg) dr surono made a joint press release at the bnpb command post in yogyakarta as of 3 december 2010 at 09.00 am the cvghm (pvmbg) lowered the status of mount merapi to the level of caution alert (level iii) they clarified that with this alert level the potential of hot ash clouds and projected incandescent material remained the geological agency provided several recommendations including that there would be no community activities in the disaster prone areas and proclaimed an ongoing exclusion zone of 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) radius
== monitoring ==
mount merapi is the site of a very active volcano monitoring program seismic monitoring began in 1924 with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present the babadan (northwest location) selo (in the saddle between merbabu and merapi) and plawangan monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment during the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption and newer posts were re-located similarly after the 1994 eruption the plawangan post and equipment were moved into kaliurang as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point
the eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm the network of 8 seismographs currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the hypocentres of tremors and quakes
a zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5 km below the summit and is thought to be the location of the magma reservoir which feeds the eruptions
other measurements taken on the volcano include magnetic measurements and tilt measurements small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up
lahars (a type of mudflow of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain and are caused by rain remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits lahars can be detected seismically as they cause a high-frequency seismic signal observations have found that about 50 mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated
== sabo dam ==
there are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged the cost for recovery is about rp.1 trillion ($116 million)
== sterile zone ==
following the 2010 eruption three indonesian government departments declared a prohibited zone which nobody can permanently stay and no infrastructure is allowed in 9 villages (dusun): palemsari pangukrejo kaliadem jambu kopeng petung kalitengah lor kalitengah kidul and srunen all in cangkringan district
== national park ==
in 2004 an area of 6,410 hectares around mount merapi was established as a national park the decision of the ministry of forestry to declare the park has been subsequently challenged in court by the indonesian forum for environment on grounds of lack of consultation with local residents during the 2006 eruption of the volcano it was reported that many residents were reluctant to leave because they feared their residences would be confiscated for expansion of the national park meaning they wouldn't have a house
== museum ==
merapi museum center kaliurang street kilometer 25.7 pakem subdistrict sleman yogyakarta a replica of merapi's post 2010 eruption has been created and indonesian student visits to the museum has increased 30 percent since the latest eruption
== mythology ==
merapi is very important to javanese especially those living around its crater as such there are many myths and beliefs attached to merapi
=== creation ===
although most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of mount merapi they have numerous commonalities it is believed that when the gods had just created the earth java was unbalanced because of the placement of mount jamurdipo on the west end of the island in order to assure balance the gods (generally represented by batara guru) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of java however two armourers empu rama and empu permadi were already forging a sacred keris at the site where mount jamurdipo was to be moved the gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there and that they should leave; empu rama and empu permadi ignored that warning in anger the gods buried empu rama and empu permadi under mount jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area in memory of them mount jamurdipo was later renamed mount merapi which means "fire of rama and permadi."
=== spirit kraton of merapi ===
the javanese believe that the earth is not only populated by human beings but also by spirits (makhluk halus) villages near merapi believe that one of the palaces (in javanese kraton) used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside merapi ruled by empu rama and empu permadi this palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the yogyakarta sultanate complete with roads soldiers princes vehicles and domesticated animals besides the rulers the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of ancestors who died as righteous people the spirits of these ancestors are said to live in the palace as royal servants (abdi dalem) occasionally visiting their descendants in dreams to give prophecies or warnings "
=== spirits of merapi ===
to keep the volcano quiet and to appease the spirits of the mountain the javanese regularly bring offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of yogyakarta's coronation for yogyakarta sultanate merapi holds significant cosmological symbolism because it is forming a sacred north-south axis line between merapi peak and southern ocean (indian ocean) the sacred axis is signified by merapi peak in the north the tugu yogyakarta monument near yogyakarta main train station the axis runs along malioboro street to northern alun-alun (square) across keraton yogyakarta (sultan palace) southern alun-alun all the way to bantul and finally reach samas and parangkusumo beach on the estuary of opak river and southern ocean this sacred axis connected the hyangs or spirits of mountain revered since ancient timesoften identified as "mbah petruk" by javanese peoplethe sultan of yogyakarta as the leader of the javanese kingdom and nyi roro kidul as the queen of the southern ocean the female ocean deity revered by javanese people and also mythical consort of javanese kings
